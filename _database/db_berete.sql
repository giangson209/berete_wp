cho một tổ chức kinh doanh nào.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mọi người đều được tham gia, không phân biệt về tiền bạc, khả năng về lập trình…</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Không trả tiền cho Speakers, nếu có chi phí thêm thì chỉ là những chi phí cho meetup như thuê địa điểm, nước uống.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Các meetup có thể do bất cứ ai trong group mà có thể tin tưởng được để tổ chức.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Không có các hành động xúc phạm về bất cứ ai, bất cứ vấn đề gì trong meetup.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3af.png\" alt=\"🎯\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em;

Vì Chế độ xem danh sách cung cấp cho bạn cái nhìn tổng quan về tất cả các khối trong nội dung của bạn, giờ đây bạn có thể điều hướng nhanh chóng đến khối chính xác mà bạn cần.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png\" alt=\"Xem trước mẫu block\" width=\"370\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption>Xem trước mẫu block trước khi thêm vào</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chuyển Widget thành Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Đây là một cập nhật đáng chú ý, chuyển giao diện Widget bản mặc định sang giao diện trình chỉnh sửa Block. Trong trường hợp giao diện không tương thích, bạn nên chuyển ngược lại bằng cách cài plugin <a href=\"https://vi.wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Classic Widgets</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-widgets-blocks.png\" alt=\"Block widget mới\" width=\"356\" height=\"267\" /><figcaption>Block cho phép nhúng widget mới</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://kweb.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/widget-area.png\" alt=\"Khu vực widget area mới trong WordPress 5.8\" class=\"wp-image-901\" width=\"459\" height=\"216\" /><figcaption>Giao diện Widget Area mới</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hiển thị bài viết trong Block Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-query-loop.png\" alt=\"Block cho phép chèn danh sách bài viết\" width=\"385\" height=\"305\" /><figcaption>Block cho phép chèn danh sách bài viết</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Trong phiên bản WordPress 5.8, một trong những vấn đề đau đầu là cách hiển thị block danh sách bài viết đã được xử lý.

Khi các khối tăng lên, các mẫu xuất hiện và việc tạo nội dung trở nên dễ dàng hơn, cần có các giải pháp mới để làm cho nội dung phức tạp dễ điều hướng. Chế độ xem danh sách (List View) là cách tốt nhất để chuyển giữa các lớp nội dung và các block lồng nhau.

Ngay bây giờ, bạn có thể dùng thử trong Block Bài viết và Block Mạng xã hội. Khi nhiều mẫu được thêm vào, bạn sẽ có thể lấy cảm hứng để tạo kiểu cho trang web của mình mà không cần rời khỏi công cụ chỉnh sửa!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tạo kiểu và tô màu cho hình ảnh</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png\" alt=\"Thêm màu 2 lớp vào đối tượng\" width=\"453\" height=\"370\" /><figcaption>Thêm màu 2 lớp vào đối tượng</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tô màu các khối hình ảnh và bìa của bạn bằng các bộ lọc duotone! Duotone có thể thêm màu sắc vào thiết kế của bạn và tạo kiểu cho hình ảnh của bạn (hoặc video) để tích hợp tốt với giao diện của bạn. Bạn có thể nghĩ về hiệu ứng duotone như một bộ lọc đen trắng, nhưng thay vì bóng tối có màu đen và các điểm sáng có màu trắng, bạn chọn màu của riêng mình cho bóng tối và vùng sáng.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Đối với lập trình viên</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Đăng ký style chung và api của giao diện thông qua file <strong>theme.json</strong></li><li>Ngừng hỗ trợ IE11</li><li>Thêm format ảnh WebP</li><li>Thêm một số phần mở rộng tùy chỉnh cho block</li><li>Giới thiệu <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/07/03/wordpress-5-8-field-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Field Guide</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bài lược dịch từ <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/tatum/\" target=\"_blank\">Giới thiệu WordPress 5.8</a> Tatum bởi <a href=\"https://kweb.vn/ban-cap-nhat-wordpress-5-8-co-gi-moi/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://kweb.vn/ban-cap-nhat-wordpress-5-8-co-gi-moi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">KWeb</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"https://vi.wordpress.org/2021/07/21/wordpress-5-8/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"\n		\n		\n					\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n					\n			\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"Cập nhật bảo mật WordPress 5.7.2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://vi.wordpress.org/2021/05/13/cap-nhat-bao-mat-wordpress-5-7-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://vi.wordpress.org/2021/05/13/cap-nhat-bao-mat-wordpress-5-7-2/#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 May 2021 13:46:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17:\"Bản nâng cấp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://vi.wordpress.org/?p=985\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:365:\"Vào ngày 12/05/2021, bản cập nhật WordPress 5.7.2 đã được phát hành để khắc phục một lỗi bảo mật với PHPMailer.

There&#8217;s so much that has happened in the past decade yet it feels very much like we&#8217;re on the cusp of something even more exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This morning started well; I pulled the hammock out of the garage (it had been hiding from the rain) and read for a bit, trying to get my 5-10 minutes of sun in the first 30 minutes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1481842978117271560?lang=en\">like Huberman suggests</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Candidly, the last year was a really challenging one for me personally. There were some beautiful moments, and I consider myself the most lucky in my family, friends, and colleagues, yet among that same group there was a lot of loss, existential health challenges, and that weighed heavily on me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually when people ask me what I want for my birthday I don&#8217;t have a good answer, but this year I do! As <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/san-francisco-bay-bridge-lights-17708825.php\">Heather Knight wrote about in the SF Chronicle, the beloved Bay Lights are coming down in March</a>. This has to happen — the vibrations and corrosive environment of the Bay Bridge is taking lights out strand by strand. Fortunately it&#8217;s now been a decade since the lights first went up, and there&#8217;s much better technology both for the lights and how they&#8217;re mounted and attached to the suspension cables. Finally, the lights were not visible from Treasure Island or the East Bay before, but this new version 3.0 will be, which is why the artist behind the lights, <a href=\"http://villareal.net/\">Leo Villereal</a>, is calling it Bay Lights 360.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series\">Foundation series</a>, we can&#8217;t stop the coming period of darkness from happening, but if we raise $11M we can bring the lights back. If we raise it soon we can shorten the time they&#8217;re down to just a few months, so I&#8217;m working with the 501c3 non-profit <a href=\"https://illuminate.org/\">Illuminate</a> to help fundraise. The idea is to find ten people or organizations to put one million each, and raise the final million in a broader crowdfunding campaign, to re-light the Bay Bridge and give an incredible gift to the people from every walk of life that see the bridge, and hopefully have their spirits lifted by the art. I&#8217;ve heard 25 million people see the Bay Lights every year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a lot to raise, but every little bit helps so <a href=\"https://illuminate.org/baylights360/\">please donate here</a>, and if you are interested to do a larger gift please get in touch. I&#8217;m committing a million dollars to the fundraise, and myself, Illuminate director Ben Davis, and the artist <a href=\"http://villareal.net/\">Leo Villereal</a> are happy to personally connect with anyone considering a larger donation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of some family health reasons I&#8217;m back in lockdown, so going to try and throw an online party tonight in the &#8220;Matterverse.&#8221; We&#8217;re going to party like it&#8217;s late 2020. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f389.png\" alt=\"🎉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 04:37:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: Automattic Launches Blaze Ad Network for Jetpack and WordPress.com Sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=140985\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-launches-blaze-ad-network-for-jetpack-and-wordpress-com-sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5113:\"<p>Automattic is <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/01/11/promote-your-posts-on-wordpress-com/\">bringing Tumblr&#8217;s Blaze ad tool to WordPress sites</a> with its launch today on WordPress.com and Jetpack. Blaze made its debut in April 2022, to the delight of Tumblr users who will gladly shell out cash to get people to look at their cat or <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/yu1l2g/you_know_i_had_to_do_it_to_em_it_being_ruthless/\">promote a game they made</a>. It&#8217;s an affordable way to attract new followers or just send out something funny into the universe, starting at $5/day.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Note To all small Twitch streamers. Tumblr Blaze is the best advertising tool out there. It has an embedding feature allowing you to embed streams. I went from 20 to 100+ live viewers rn! <a href=\"https://t.co/aolZduCTEe\">pic.twitter.com/aolZduCTEe</a></p>&mdash; Ian Miles Cheong\'s Prime Minister (@MToph91) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MToph91/status/1610290440946999303?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 3, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com users can now to go to&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://wordpress.com/advertising\">wordpress.com/advertising</a></strong>, select a site, and promote content with Blaze. Jetpack users have access to the ad network inside the WordPress.com dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>After selecting a post, users are taken to the design wizard where they can add an image, title, a snippet, and a destination URL. The URL can be the post or page or it can direct visitors to the main website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Blaze first launched on Tumblr there was no way to target the promoted content &#8211; it just displayed to random users. Now there are a few more options. When promoting content from WordPress.com or a Jetpack-enabled site, users can narrow the audience by device: mobile, desktop, or all devices, select from a few main geographic areas (continents) or serve it everywhere. There is also a dropdown with topics of interest, but they are fairly general, e.g. Arts &amp; Entertainment, Automotive, Business, Education.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>After selecting the audience, users can set the budget for the campaign, starting at $5 with a max daily budget of $50. With a minimum of $5/day for a week users can expect an estimated 5,900 &#8211; 8,000 impressions. For $25/day, users can expect 29,700 &#8211; 40,200, and up to 59,500 &#8211; 80,500 for $50/day. Site owners can monitor the success of their ads in the Campaigns tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content sponsored by Blaze will be promoted across WordPress.com sites and Tumblr pages, an audience that accounts for an estimated 13.5 billion impressions per month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blazing has become somewhat of an art in the short time it has been available on Tumblr.  It will be interesting to see how ads originating from WordPress.com and Jetpack go over with the Tumblr audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There\'s a whole code of ethics around Blaze on Tumblr basically if you use it to do anything other than shitpost people hate you, you can also buy Tumblr merch and buy fake verification (which isn\'t seen as a serious thing, it\'s just a way to support tumblr)</p>&mdash; New Year New Simisear Fan <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f400.png\" alt=\"🐀\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> (@LakeUncalming) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LakeUncalming/status/1612677568741646342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 10, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"tumblr-post\"><a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/madmadammims/700822694806044672\">https://www.tumblr.com/madmadammims/700822694806044672</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating advertising content that works across the disparate audiences between WordPress and Tumblr-powered pages may be a challenge for some site owners. Tumblr users can only <a href=\"https://help.tumblr.com/hc/en-us/articles/5298854249367-Tumblr-Blaze-FAQ\">target audiences by location</a> for blazed posts. It&#8217;s possible that WordPress&#8217; additional targeting options can help funnel the ads to sites where they will be most well-received, but the announcement says ads will be promoted across WordPress.com and Tumblr.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blaze campaigns require approval to be in compliance with Automattic&#8217;s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://automattic.com/advertising-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">Advertising Policy</a> before being published. They are currently moderated in approximately 30 minutes but this may change in the future as more users try out Blaze. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic is treading new ground in creating its own ad network that any user across Tumblr and WordPress can tap into. It&#8217;s a strategic move to extend access to the world of WordPress, given that it&#8217;s such a large audience, and it will be interesting to see how the company improves the targeting options to meet the challenges of serving both audiences.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 22:52:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"Post Status: Improving 5ftF Contributor Journey • Building Interactive Blocks • Layout Classes • WP20\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=146399\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"https://poststatus.com/improving-5ftf-contributor-journey-building-interactive-blocks-layout-classes-wp20/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16934:\"<h2 id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-january-9-2023\">This Week at WordPress.org (January 9, 2023)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Share your feedback about how to improve the Five for the Future contributor journey.

As WordPress continues to evolve, ClassicPress fell behind in pursuit of PHP 8+ compatibility. The fork is based on WordPress 4.9 and users are increasingly limited in what plugins will work with the five-year-old codebase. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://forums.classicpress.net/t/the-future-of-classicpress-discussion/4480/31\">discussion</a> limited to ClassicPress core contributors, Viktor Nagornyy, one of the project’s directors, announced the results of the vote: <strong>&#8220;The option to re-fork has 20 votes while continue-as-is has 18.&#8221;  </strong>Nagornyy summarized previous discussions and suggested an approach that would be more realistic for the project&#8217;s limited contributors:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>ClassicPress can’t be WordPress without Gutenberg, but it also can’t be its own CMS with a small core team at this time. There are simply not enough developers to make progress without backporting code from WP to move away from WP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An almost even split in the poll suggests the best option might be a hybrid one, find a compromise solution that will satisfy both sides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a small core team, we have to find ways to be more efficient, to get more done with less. The only way to do that is to leverage all the work that’s done by WP contributors. As the core team grows, we can always explore the possibility of splitting away from WP but at this point in time, it’s simply not feasible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Some participants in the previous discussion saw re-forking as postponing the inevitable, kicking the can down the road until the next re-fork, but it is the only option if users want to retain compatibility with the rest of the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If you read recent threads, you find out that the community expects plugin compatibility with WordPress… another reason for the re-fork option,&#8221; ClassicPress core committer Álvaro Franz said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Franz, who is also the author of the WP-CMS fork based on WordPress 6.0, previously <a href=\"https://forums.classicpress.net/t/community-poll-the-future-of-classicpress/4446/46\">said</a> he would be unwilling to help with a continuation of the current version based on WordPress 4.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It [ClassicPress] doesn’t have to be a competition (and it never could compete with WordPress anyways), but it can be a leaner version, for people who are already disabling Gutenberg via plugins, for developers who want a different approach to the way they develop their projects (closer to &#8216;the classic&#8217; experience, but yet… modern!),&#8221; Franz <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/classicpress-at-a-crossroads-directors-consider-re-forking-wordpress#comment-435736\">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Eventually, it won’t make sense to run a fresh copy of WordPress to then go and install a plugin that &#8216;disables&#8217; half of it. What’s the point? Why not have a version that covers that specific use case?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of Nagornyy&#8217;s proposed hybrid approach, he suggested the project retain some changes that were introduced in ClassicPress in v1.x, such as the privacy-oriented changes (anonymizing data CP sends to APIs), the news widget, and ensure that all API endpoints use ClassicPress APIs as in v1.x.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion continues around how to proceed with the fork. ClassicPress contributors are leaning towards using Franz&#8217;s WP-CMS fork based on WordPress 6.0 but have not finalized the details yet.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 15:10:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: #58 – Lax Mariappan on How Headless WordPress Works\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=140972\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/58-lax-mariappan-on-how-headless-wordpress-works\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56075:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox has a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how Headless WordPress works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players. If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, well, I&#8217;m very keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you or your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Lax Mariappan. Lax is a web developer based in the Philippines. He&#8217;s an open source enthusiast and lover of all things WordPress. Lax has been tinkering with websites since high school. But it all changed when he discovered WordPress in 2010. Lax currently works as a backend engineer at WebDevStudios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked today about Headless WordPress, and it&#8217;s a complex topic. Headless is the concept of decoupling the WordPress admin from the front end of the site. WordPress will continue to work as expected, but the presentation layer will be done by a different technology. React Gatsby and Remix being some popular choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This implementation of WordPress is complex, requires technical knowledge above and beyond that needed for a more typical WordPress install. But it has its benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lax talks through all of this in great detail. How keeping on top of all the additional dependencies Headless WordPress requires can be time consuming. How it can create difficulties for content editors who don&#8217;t always get to see what their work will actually look like in real time. Why this approach to WordPress can take more time and resources during the build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lex explains how these problems typically crop up, and how it&#8217;s possible to plan ahead and build in solutions for all the problems that you might encounter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever thought about going headless with WordPress, then the podcast today is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Lax Mariappan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Lax Mariappan. Hello Lax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:30] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Hello, Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very nice to have you with us on the show today. I have to commend you for your staying power, because Lax and I have tried to record this episode a couple of times and he&#8217;s been incredibly, incredibly thoughtful about getting his, all of his equipment and everything working. So thank you, first of all, I would like to express my gratitude for you staying the course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we get into the podcast, Lax, I wonder if you wouldn&#8217;t mind spending a moment just introduce yourself. Tell us who you are, where you are, who you work for, how long you&#8217;ve been using WordPress, all of those kind of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:06] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Thank you. It&#8217;s good to be on WP Tavern, it&#8217;s one of my favorite publications, and also the favorite podcast. So I&#8217;m Lax, Lax Mariappan. I&#8217;m from India, and also I&#8217;m from Philippines. So I would say I live in both countries, and I use WordPress since my school days, like 2009. So I was looking for a platform to build a website for an event or something, and then I found out Blogger versus WordPress, and I liked WordPress more even that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So since then, I&#8217;m using WordPress almost every day. And my first job I got started working as a PHP developer, I would say, and then fully focused on WordPress. And I wrote my first plugin in 2011. It&#8217;s a very simple one. It&#8217;s now kind of obsolete because Facebook changed it a lot. So I wrote a plugin for something to fetch Facebook feed. So, and then my journey goes on. Right now, I work as a backend engineer at WebDevStudios. So where I get a chance to learn and work more with headless CMS every day almost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Your work at WebDevStudios, I don&#8217;t know a great deal about the company, but my impression of the company is that you work with, how should we describe it? Enterprise clients. You&#8217;re dealing with fairly large projects. I would imagine sizable budgets. Those kind of things, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:27] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Yeah, yes. Enterprise level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So when we decided we were going to have this conversation, Lax introduced the subject to me of headless WordPress. Now this is a word which I imagine some of you have heard before. Maybe some of you have never heard the word before. Perhaps there&#8217;s a subset of you which have experimented with it, but I&#8217;m expecting that the majority of WordPress users have not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, first of all Lax, would you mind giving us a very, in depth I suppose is the right word. Give us an analysis of what headless WordPress is because I&#8217;m sure many people think they know what it is, but perhaps they don&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:06] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> So headless, or decoupled CMS, so first we all know content management system, right? So WordPress, we are using WordPress now as a content management system. It started out as a blogging platform. We used it mainly for blogging. And then WordPress introduced custom post types, taxonomies and all that sort of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are now using WordPress to build simple to complex websites. Forums. Some people use it for their colleges, universities as a social media platform, and some of them use it for a job board and everything, right? So we have plugin for everything and we can customize it and we use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when it comes to the traditional CMS, we call that as monolithic. I hope I&#8217;m not using too much jargon here. Monolithic in the sense it has everything into it. So for example, if you go to a website, the header, footer, the sidebar, and the content that you see and the forms and everything that comes from the same CMS itself. So it is going to be, let&#8217;s say, in the case of WordPress, it&#8217;s built mostly with PHP and JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So everything is going to be PHP template with a bit of JavaScript and CSS to it. But when you say on the contrast, headless CMS, it means, so you can consider that as a, I would not say person. Maybe something like, you can imagine something that doesn&#8217;t have a head. So in the sense the body is the same, head is different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can imagine that as, you are going to use the same admin panel and you are going to have the same WordPress features. You can add the content, you can add menus, you can edit anything, you can add users, all that stuff. But when I view the website, so it&#8217;s not going to be your theme. So it&#8217;s not the typical way of how WordPress gets rendered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead we will be decoupling it. So that is WordPress admin will stay on another site. It can be on a subdomain or a sub folder, but the front end is going to be a different platform. So it&#8217;s going to be hosted in a, mostly a JavaScript based stuff. So you can use either React based frameworks like React itself or Gatsby, Next.js or Remix, or anything that you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also you can either go in another route as well. So you can make it like a fully static website, or you can render it on every time as a server side rendering as well. So every call will go to the server and renders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so now we can call that a small intro about headless. You may already know this one. It became a buzzword a couple of years ago, right? But now everyone wants to go as headless. I see that company goes headless, or my competitor goes headless. So I want to go that way. But, unpopular opinion. Maybe you might hear some other people say that too. Headless is not for everyone, or I would say not for every use case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It depends on how much content that you publish. What are your goals and what you want to achieve. So headless is good, it&#8217;s performant, it&#8217;s fast, secure, and it gives you more freedom and flexibility, especially in terms of performance it&#8217;s really good. But I would say it&#8217;s not the something like you should go headless. It&#8217;s not the answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So essentially you&#8217;re saying that there are scenarios where this is desirable, but there&#8217;s going to be other scenarios where WordPress, in the traditional sense of the word. The regular WordPress that you download, perhaps use a hosting company and it&#8217;s all driven by PHP. The normal way of doing WordPress. That might be the best solution for lots of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so we&#8217;ve got our WordPress website, which we can interact with, and then the content that comes out of that website is pushed to something else. And probably we&#8217;ll get into what the options are there. But let&#8217;s take the use case of a company which comes to you and says, okay, we&#8217;ve heard this buzzword. We think that we want to go headless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the benefits of going headless? Let&#8217;s forget about all the problems that might be associated with it. Can we just iterate through the things that you will gain if you manage to pull off a headless WordPress website. Now, I know there&#8217;s going to be all sorts of different scenarios there, but maybe just pick out the low hanging fruit. Some of the things which you believe are really beneficial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:17] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Yeah. The first and foremost, or the popular one, is the performance. So WordPress uses PHP templates. We will do everything with PHP and Javascript and also a little bit of caching to render our traditional CMS like traditional pages. If you use a normal WordPress installation with a theme. So that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s get rendered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there you can see it depends on the hosting company as well, and also how much plugins that you use and how you configured them. So that affects the performance of a site. But when it comes to headless everything is going to be bundled, and there will be how a normal JavaScript based application gets rendered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s going to be a modern web application where you have control over, for example, if your page doesn&#8217;t use certain CSS classes, those CSS will not get loaded for that page. So I would say the assets that are loaded, it will be less. And the images will be more optimized. In either case, like in traditional too you can optimize images, but it&#8217;s like the performance is the first one, I would say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s going to be both developers will love it and also the site owners, and also, let&#8217;s say marketers, Everyone will like the performance aspect of it. And in terms of headless, I would say developers will like it, especially in terms of, so you can repurpose the content. So if you are having a CMS, WordPress as a headless CMS, you can use that same endpoint, get the data and display it in a different formats quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than a WordPress theme. So for example, if you&#8217;re using a WordPress theme, you have to create multiple templates. So this is a template for mobile, and this is something that, for example, if you want to use it for a landing page, you may have to do some small or extra changes. But when it comes to headless, you can just customize it in a way that you want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, I want to have a landing page. I don&#8217;t want certain stuff to be there. So you can turn on, off certain components, that&#8217;s it. So it&#8217;s like you can render the blocks and render the content faster. So developers and designers will like it. And also, in terms of the security, that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m more interested in cybersecurity especially. When people say WordPress sites are not secure, that triggers me actually. Yeah, I do get angry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s like, you don&#8217;t have to worry about that. So you don&#8217;t have to worry about changing your login page url. Adding captcha to your login form, all that stuff. Because that URL is going to be safe and secure. No one knows where you are hosted your CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I just interrupt there? So could you explain that, because I imagine there&#8217;s a bunch of people scratching their head at this point. Because normally, let&#8217;s say you have a website, it&#8217;s example.com. You&#8217;re going to go to example.com/wp-admin, and there is your login page. But there&#8217;s something in between here. I&#8217;m not sure that we explained that quite. So just explain why the login is secure. Explain where it is and why it&#8217;s not normal WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:19] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Yeah, so I mean, normal WebPress is also secure but people can guess it, right? Say example.com/wp-admin, so they know. They can see from the source code and the page source, they can see oh, this looks like a WordPress site. And then they can guess the admin url. So slash wp-admin, it&#8217;ll redirect them to the login page, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when it comes to headless, the example.com will be hosted somewhere, and the front end that you see will be different. So for example, let&#8217;s say CMS is your WordPress installation, all WP. So you can call that like wp.example.com. So that&#8217;s where your WordPress stays in. But when you go to the example.com, that&#8217;s your front end, so that&#8217;s just JavaScript and html. So it&#8217;s like, if somebody wants to hack your site or somebody wants to, just guess what will be the admin url. So they cannot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s a difficult concept to understand if you haven&#8217;t encountered this before. But what you&#8217;ve got basically is a WordPress website, which is the container for the content, but it isn&#8217;t the website and we&#8217;re not used to that in traditional WordPress. You go to example.com/ wp-admin, get redirected, log in, do all the things, and click publish, and as soon as you click publish, it will be present on the website. That&#8217;s not the way that this is working because the WordPress website is completely decoupled from the thing which is presenting it to the world, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:48] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Completely decoupled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So given that, there&#8217;s no connection between, okay, here&#8217;s my website at example.com and where I might log in. And because of that there isn&#8217;t the capability to just guess the login page and then bruteforce an attack and so on. So in terms of security, it offers that benefit. The thing which people are most worried about, somebody getting your admin password going in and spoiling your site. That&#8217;s highly unlikely because they simply won&#8217;t know where to look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:23] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Yeah. And also, so for example certain normal pages like comments, so that&#8217;s where we get a lot of spam, right? So comments will go to comments.php. When you submit a form without any data, or maybe if it&#8217;s spam data, it just goes there, right? But when it comes to headless, we will be using some extra customization for the comments and everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s not going to be the data will store as comments in the database, and it&#8217;ll be, you can view them as comments in the admin panel. But when you are viewing it in the site, so you are reading a blog post, you have a comment form, so that form is HTML and JavaScript. So that&#8217;s not how a typical, a normal WordPress form, normal comments form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s where you will get less spam as well. So you don&#8217;t have to worry about that too. Like people submitting spam data and also any other form. So that&#8217;s another thing. And you don&#8217;t have to worry about any other security related stuff, because it&#8217;s just static.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So people cannot do anything or manipulate data. So it&#8217;s going to be just HTML stuff. Whatever they can do is just view the data. So I would say in the headless, so if you are viewing some pages or we are in a archive page and post archive, news archive, any archive page or any other page that does the data and fetches the data from the database, all that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So all that stuff will be protected routes. So people cannot easily guess. Sometimes you might encounter database related attacks, right. So you may hear cross site scripting attack or any other stuff like, somebody trying to get data either they pull your data or they want to insert some other data to the database. That&#8217;s not the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything is going to be static, like just html, and it&#8217;s only read only. So people are not going to input any data. And the input will be just maybe a comments form, contact us form, something like that. And that will be handled. It depends on what form provider you are using, or how you configure it, but still it&#8217;s more secure that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So just to reiterate the point one more time, just in case anybody hasn&#8217;t been paying attention. We have our WordPress website. It is used by the developers, by the content creators, by the editors. They do their normal work inside of WordPress, but the thing which is being viewed on the front end by the population at large is completely separate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re just sucking the data out of WordPress and putting it into whatever you like. The security&#8217;s fairly obvious, you&#8217;ve explained that really well. The performance, obviously, if all that you are showing is static html, essentially. That&#8217;s going to load really, really quickly. Nothing needs to be built at the time that the page is viewed and so on and so forth. It&#8217;s already been created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This all sounds amazing and of course that raises the question, why aren&#8217;t we all doing it? And you have given us, in the show notes you&#8217;ve given me, three different things which we perhaps should talk about, and some of them, you explained the problem and then we&#8217;ll get to the solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one that you talk about is dependency hell, you&#8217;ve described it as. And, I&#8217;m guessing that having a headless site is not straightforward. We&#8217;re very used in WordPress to, novices can install WordPress incredibly quickly. You basically upload a zip file and unpack it and connect it to a database, and these days, you know, you go to a hosting company and not even that. You just click a button and, wow, there&#8217;s your WordPress website 30 seconds later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m guessing that this is not the case for headless. There must be all sorts of complex layers of things going on in the background, and you say that in many cases it can become very difficult. Dependency hell. So describe the problem of all the dependencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:13] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> So when you have a WordPress installation, we will be installing plugins, right? You might be, if you are using WordPress for a while, you are already aware of the jQuery migrate plugin. All that stuff. So WordPress uses jQuery even now. So jQuery is a dependency that WordPress requires. WordPress depends on jQuery in admin panel, and also on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want to get rid of jQuery, it&#8217;s kind of, WordPress may not be the same, if you want to eliminate that. Because WordPress depends on it. So it&#8217;s something like, let&#8217;s say you cannot say that as a oxygen, but it&#8217;s something that we all need it. So we need that to survive. So WordPress needs jQuery to work normally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So similar case, when you are building a headless site, you will be requiring a lot of frameworks, libraries, and also packages. So for example, if I&#8217;m going to choose Next.js as my front end platform, front end framework. So Next.js is built with React. If I want to use Next.js, I may want to use some other Next.js related libraries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it is something like if you are on Android, you may want to add extra apps on your phone. If you are an iPhone, you&#8217;ll be adding some more extra apps to extend, right? It&#8217;s the same case. Similar to plugins. Instead of that plugins, we will be adding packages. So that packages helps the developers to add extra features that we need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the problem here comes in is, everything gets stacked in and one will be dependent on another. So, for example, if someone is installing a package like for SEO, and maybe that package will require something else. And let&#8217;s say if Nathan is maintaining SEO package and I installed it, and for example, for whatever reason, Nathan becomes a musician and he doesn&#8217;t, he is not interested in SEO anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So he may not be more active in maintaining that dependency, maintaining that plugin or that package. So what happens is I&#8217;ll be waiting for him to fix the bug or some errors. Or I will waiting for him to upgrade to the lightest version. But it&#8217;s not the case, right? So, my Next.js package will be waiting for Nathan, so it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m depending on him, but he&#8217;s not available. So in that case, I have to go and do that work as well. So that adds to our development timeline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, so this is just one package and one scenario. So this happens with multiple packages and stuff. And this is not just Node or NPM packages. It also happens to WordPress stuff as well. So, for example, let&#8217;s say we have a popular forms plugin, or we have a popular slider or any other plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you will install that plugin and you want that plugin to work with headless. So how we are using headless, it&#8217;s the data is stored in the WordPress, and we want to get the data through either Rest API. It&#8217;s a method that we, you know, you go to a url, you ask the WordPress, hey, give me this data and it&#8217;s going to give. Or you&#8217;ll be using GraphQL. It&#8217;s the same. You go to an endpoint and you&#8217;re going to say, hey, I&#8217;m looking for this post. I want five posts from this date. So it&#8217;s going to give that data as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So either you use Rest API or GraphQL. The problem is a plugin that you are using, your popular forms plugin, your popular slider, or any other plugin that you&#8217;re using. LMS plugin, E-commerce plugin or any plugin, like a payment gateway. So you have a plugin and you want to use it with headless. So that plugin should work with the Rest API or Graph QL. So if that doesn&#8217;t work, if that doesn&#8217;t give you the flexibility, and then you are still stuck there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you cannot go and create everything on your own, right? So we cannot reinvent all the wheels. We don&#8217;t have time to create everything from scratch. So that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s like that becomes a bottleneck. So you are like, hey, I found the plugin. I started working on it. It works up to this mark, but it&#8217;s not a hundred percent. So it&#8217;s like it does its job 80%. Now I have to go fill in that 20%. It adds to the budget, it adds to the development timeline. So that&#8217;s the dependency hell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. So in the case of all of the technology, which is in the background if you like, which we haven&#8217;t really talked about too much, but like you said, the things which you are requiring from third party developers. There&#8217;s a dependency there, and it&#8217;s very similar to the dependency that you may have on plugins, you know, you want them to be updated and so on, but you are adding extra dependencies. And of course, the more dependencies you&#8217;ve got, the more costly, time consuming it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m guessing that most of the things that you are depending on, in addition to WordPress and you described what a few of those were, you could, I suppose, do some due diligence and figure out which projects have been well maintained, updated frequently, and so on. And I guess in the open source world, much of the dependencies that you&#8217;re using will be open sourced, so you could fork them. But again, you are creating probably a large amount of work for yourself and your team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:13] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Yeah that&#8217;s true. Well said. So it&#8217;s like, since it is open source, it&#8217;s good. Like lot of reviewers. We have a lot of eyes on the code, and you can fork it. You have the freedom to do whatever you want. But still you are looking for a solution and that becomes a problem. You have to fix that as well. And that adds to the, another dependency, another dependency. It becomes a cycle that you cannot escape sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess this is a bit like a seesaw. You know, on the one hand you described all of the benefits, performance, security, and so on, of headless. And then on the other side is, is all of the things that we are now describing. You know, the dependencies and so on. You&#8217;ve got to weigh up at the beginning of the project whether one thing is worth all of the time and effort that may be required to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m guessing in many cases, certainly at the enterprise level, the answer&#8217;s going to be yes, because the budget is there, we can put enough bodies to work to make all of this happen, and if we need to fork things, there&#8217;s enough people on the team that can do that and maintain the project, which has fallen into disuse. But for a little project the seasaw may tip heavily against something like headless just because of the things that you&#8217;ve described there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So that was our first thing, dependency hell. The second thing that you wanted to talk about was the fact that in the WordPress world, especially in the last five or six years or so, we are really used to what you see is what you get, WYSIWYG. You save something in WordPress, you publish something and you have almost a hundred percent certainty of what it&#8217;s going to look like. The backend looks like the front end, especially with things like page builders and so on. But you say that that&#8217;s not always the case with headless solutions. Why is that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:55] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> We will be creating custom blocks. So, either there are a popular way of building now custom blocks is with ACF. So you all might be aware of and using it, even though you are not a programmer, you might be using it, right? So ACF is easy to install and create some custom fields. So you can use ACF to block, to build blocks for the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those blocks can be used or you can build your own custom blocks. You can use any block starters like, frameworks that are available now. Or you can just follow our, WordPress comes with packages that you can on build command, so you can just build your block in a matter of seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But still, all this stuff. So for example, if you are having custom blocks, I&#8217;m not talking about just normal blocks, like where you add a paragraph or image or something very simple. That is easy to build and that&#8217;s easy to see. That&#8217;s different. But I&#8217;m here talking about something complex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example, you can imagine that as an Elementor widget or, some other items that it comes with the page builders. So, let&#8217;s say a slider, maybe tabs, accordions, all that stuff, right? So that can be added through the blocks itself. But you cannot preview them, because when you add them in the admin panel and we add them in the content. Those content gets, you know, you can choose like, oh, this is the tab title, this is the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can keep adding the content, but you don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s going to render in the front end. But let&#8217;s say if you are using some, there are a lot of free blocks and also even premium blocks available. So if you are using a block to build them, and then using the normal WordPress installation. Or you can use WordPress with the full site editing, the modern themes, or the hybrid themes, like old plus full site editing themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still they both work well. Like you can preview, oh, okay, this is the tab I added this content. I can&#8217;t view this one. But when it comes to ACF blocks or other certain custom built blocks, you cannot preview them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when a editor or a user adds content, they may get lost. So I have a slider. I want to add three, four images to it. I may get lost. Oh, what&#8217;s the third image? What I have added there, and how it looks? Is the images correct? Is the text rendered properly or should I reduce any title or text or anything, right? So all this stuff becomes a little tricky. And also sometimes it becomes a pain for the content writers, content editors, and also the site owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So in the normal, traditional WordPress, let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re creating a page, we add a page, and we use whatever tool it is that we want to use for that. We add in some blocks. We are perhaps using Elementor, whatever it may be. And we click publish and then we are able to immediately view that because WordPress is working in the traditional sense of the word. The page gets pushed through the templating engine and it&#8217;s rendered with its template and we can see it right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But because that&#8217;s not happening here. And the mechanism for rendering that page is entirely different. You can&#8217;t necessarily view it immediately. Have I kind of encapsulated that? What you are doing in the backend, because it&#8217;s decoupled with the presentation layer on the front end, you can&#8217;t necessarily always see it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:16] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Yeah, so that&#8217;s the challenge. So the solution here is to customize the way you built. So for example, we can give them a preview button so they can preview what are the slides, and how they look. And they can see that immediately in the editor itself. Like when they are adding content in the block editor, they can see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also the other way is to have a button, a preview button. So that will preview before the content gets published. So, you can change the workflow. So if somebody hits, instead of publish, you can have like a preview button or keep it as a draft. So that way it&#8217;s like nothing goes to the front end without your approval or preview, right? So you have to preview it and see, oh, make sure everything looks correct, and then you can say, hey, I want to publish it. Yes, confirm, publish it, and then it goes to the frontend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s fascinating. That&#8217;s really ingenious. So, because we can&#8217;t necessarily see it on the frontend, you and your team have built a custom preview system. So on a block by block basis, you can see what that block will look like when it&#8217;s rendered. So in the example of your slider, presumably where we&#8217;ve got three or four fields. We&#8217;ve uploaded maybe some text, we&#8217;ve uploaded an image, and it&#8217;s just a bunch of fields. Normally we&#8217;d click publish and we&#8217;d go to the page and preview the page and we&#8217;d see it right away. But in your scenario, you are going to hit a button inside the block to show what that block and that block alone will look like. Have I understood that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:48] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s what we did. Because the users, they are used to the traditional WordPress. And especially that was with classic editor, I mean the old editor. So if you insert an image, they can see it&#8217;s an image. And if you insert something, you can see. And we are all used to the page builder era, right? So if you add a accordion, you can see how the accordion is going to look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when it comes to headless, all this stuff is going to differ. So, the tabs, accordions, sliders, and also anything else, any other custom stuff that we built, we added a preview button, and when you click on the preview, you can see that right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you can make sure like, oh, the colors are correct, the image is correct, and everything renders properly. Because sometimes if you are not looking at the content and adding content, you might miss some data, right? So you might have missed a small setting that says full width, or you know, boxed. So then you feel like, oh, why this looks so awful. Oh, I&#8217;ve missed this full width button. So that&#8217;s how the preview button works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So if I&#8217;m looking at the block and it&#8217;s a, let&#8217;s stick with the slider just for the sake of it, and I&#8217;ve uploaded my images and whatever fields were required and I click the preview. Does it literally happen inside that block? Or is this some kind of modal which pops up and shows things? Or is it, is it literally taking over the block itself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:09] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Ah, it&#8217;ll be within the block. Like it will replace, so for example, if you have a block and you are adding some content to it, and when you click on the preview, it&#8217;ll replace where you are adding the content, right? It&#8217;ll replace the form. Form of the block where you are saying like, hey, this is the title, this is the subheading, this is the description. Instead of that, it&#8217;ll just render the titles, heading and description.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right, and then you toggle that off again once you&#8217;re, once you&#8217;re happy. So, ah, that&#8217;s really interesting. So the workflow there is really very different. And I&#8217;m presuming that after a period of time, the people who are editing, creating this content, that just becomes part of the process? They just understand that, okay, rather than viewing the whole page or whatever it may be, post whatever, I&#8217;m just viewing this little bit, and I&#8217;ve done it several times now and I&#8217;m confident that if it looks right inside the block preview, then I can click publish, wait for everything to happen, and hopefully that page will go live. And, it&#8217;s just a different workflow that you have to get used to. But once you&#8217;ve done it several times, it&#8217;s, familiar and normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:14] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Yeah, it becomes part of the workflow. And also, like we discussed earlier, your site will be like, CMS.example.com. And the front end will be on example.com. Sorry, every time you have to go to example.com/about, example.com slash contact us. Instead of that we will have a preview button. So, you can preview each block and you, if you, or feel like, hey, I want to see how the whole page looks like, you can click that preview, and that will take you, or that will show you immediately, oh, this is how the front end, like example.com/the page will look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a good point. We&#8217;re so used to the preview button being connected to the URL in question, because it&#8217;s being rendered by WordPress. You click the preview page button or whatever it may be, and it takes you to the correct place. In this case, there&#8217;s no connection between what the URL will be and where you currently are, so yeah, that&#8217;s fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as a bit of an aside. We haven&#8217;t got into this, but I think it would be a good topic to discuss for a couple of minutes. If WordPress is separated from the presentation layer, this sort of headless notion. How often does the website get regenerated, if you know what I mean? So for example, if we click publish in our headless WordPress website, what is typical there? Are you going to generate the page immediately and store it as static html? Or do some clients have different expectations there? You know, for example, if you are a, a site which needs to publish things regularly, perhaps you need that capability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I click publish. I want that page to be live within a matter of moments. Or it may be that you&#8217;ve got a website where it doesn&#8217;t really matter if the pages are not built, I don&#8217;t know, three hours, six hours a day, whatever it may be. Do different clients have different expectations there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:56] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Yeah, that depends on how the publication frequency is. If you want to publish immediately, we can do. If you are okay with publishing the changes after two, three hours, still we can do. So it&#8217;s about how you want to set, how you want to build the things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here, few things to consider. You can go with static, fully static website. That&#8217;s just static and only when a page gets updated. So for example, you have a hundred page. All of them are static and those pages will not be regenerated. So if you change just the about page and only that 99 pages will remain the same. Only that about page will get regenerated again. You can go that route.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also you can go with, every time in the page gets rendered, you can go server side rendering. So every time that&#8217;s new, so you can go that route as well. So that depends on how you want to render the data and everything has pros and cons. The normal way is like how Next.Js does now. Because it is like, keep everything static and if you want to render something, you can still regenerate the specific page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this way it&#8217;s like you don&#8217;t have to build everything all the time. So you can build what has changed in the WordPress. You can see that in the headless frontend. And also you don&#8217;t have to wait for it. So, for example, if I go make some change and click update and you can see that immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Really interesting, because there is no exact way of doing this is there? You can just build it in whichever way you think is most beneficial, or whatever the client needs. You know, if, if it&#8217;s a newspaper website where, really I need to click publish, and within a few moments I need that page to be live because the content that we&#8217;re creating is tremendously important to be fresh and new and so on. But it may be that, yeah, you don&#8217;t have that expectation and you&#8217;re quite happy to have it work in a different way and publish on a, a much less frequent basis. I can&#8217;t really imagine a scenario where anybody would say no, I&#8217;d rather it was published less frequently, but maybe there are scenarios where that&#8217;s beneficial. I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, and the last point that you wanted to talk about was, the whole conversation has proven to be really interesting, but it&#8217;s pretty clear that there&#8217;s a lot more work involved in this kind of website. And so your first point was about the fact that the dependencies, lots of dependencies. Your second point that was that you don&#8217;t always get to see what you see is what you get in operation. And the third one is basically the amount of time it takes, the amount of resources it takes. You&#8217;ve described this as headless asks for more. Tell us about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:34] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Yeah, so when it comes to creating a normal WordPress, like a standard WordPress theme. So what you do is like, you start with your prototyping tool. Like it can be Figma, Adobe XD or anything. So you have your design ready, right? You are creating mock-ups, discuss with the client, and then create a mock-up and then find the variations, all that stuff. And you are settling in, hey, this is my design. And now I&#8217;m going to create the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I want to create this many templates. I want to create this many menus, all that stuff. When it comes to traditional stuff, it&#8217;s like, you don&#8217;t have to consider too many things. So it&#8217;s kind of straightforward process and like designers and developers can, the engineers can work hand in hand. And it&#8217;s, you can follow Agile like, build stuff, reiterate and just deliver it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s how that works. But when it comes to headless, so you have to consider a lot of things. I would say the first thing is the knowledge or, you know, expertise. With WebDev Studios, we are, I would say kind of one of pioneers and also experts in WordPress plus headless stuff. So we have launched, it&#8217;s a open source like we have Next.js starter template. So if you want to try out Next.js a headless frontend for your WebPress site, you can just take a look at WDS Next.js starter. It&#8217;s free and it&#8217;s in GitHub, so you can just start using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, expertise comes one, like whether you should be, have sound knowledge in that. So you can go and fix stuff. You know what you are doing and you know what to expect and all that stuff. But this requires something like, for example, I am a backend engineer. I have limited React knowledge. I&#8217;m now catching up with React, Next.js, all that stuff. But I would, I would not say I&#8217;m an expert at it. I build stuff, I still use Next.js every day, but it&#8217;s like, I won&#8217;t say I&#8217;m an expert at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So expertise is one. So your team should have sound knowledge in the framework or anything that you do. Or even if you don&#8217;t have sound knowledge, let&#8217;s say if you are doing something like, something very new, like Remix got released only one or two years ago, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want to go use Remix, You should be an expert in React and you should play around with React. So that&#8217;s the time. So my point is like time, it asks for expertise and it asks for time. So when it comes to just normal WordPress theme, probably you might finish the theme, let&#8217;s say, in a few weeks, or at least a few days even sometimes. With page builders finish it in few days or few weeks, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But maybe if you are building it from scratch and you are doing a lot of customization, it may take a while. But when it comes to headless, may take even longer. So more expertise, more time, and all this adds up to more budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may sound like, oh, well should I do all this stuff? It&#8217;s kind of worth it. So you don&#8217;t have to, for example, if you have your, the front end components ready you may be having your storybook, like where you want to see how the button should look like, how the elements, how the panels are. Let&#8217;s say how each component will look like and how they render, all that stuff, right? So when you have all these parts ready, you can go from, for example, today I&#8217;m using Next.js, sooner I can move to something else, like I can use Remix. Or I can use something else that&#8217;s going to be hot in the market in future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when it comes to the typical WordPress, you are going to change everything from scratch. So if you want to add a new theme, so maybe if you want to change the look and feel, that&#8217;s different. So everything has pros and cons, but the short answer is the headless CMS ask for more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It does sound like not only do you need more time to develop all of this for the reasons you&#8217;ve just described. It&#8217;s more complicated, so it takes more time. There&#8217;s more moving parts, shall we say. And it may also be that you need to spend some of that time not just building the thing, but learning how all of this hangs together, because there&#8217;s an awful lot going on in the backend here. And if you don&#8217;t have expertise in that, presumably things could go pretty wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that just before we end. You&#8217;ve obviously decided at WebDevStudios that this is an approach. I don&#8217;t know if you build the majority of your sites in this way or subset or a proportion of them, not sure. But, typically what is the amount of time longer it would take to get a website out? Let&#8217;s say, for example, that if you were just going to use WordPress as is a normal WordPress website, and you built an exact same website, but did it headless. And let&#8217;s imagine a site with, I don&#8217;t know, several different custom post types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s got hundreds of pages. I&#8217;m just kind of making up something off the top of my head. But typically, you know, does it take twice as long, three times as long, 50% longer? What, what are we looking at?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:28] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> I&#8217;m going to answer just like other engineers do. It depends. But it&#8217;s like, I would say it takes a long, maybe you can say, maybe you can say double, but it should not take more than double or something. So that&#8217;s where I would say start with more of research. So you should not change frameworks or libraries in between. Like once you started as React, go with React. And if your team is, they are very comfortable and they&#8217;re knowledgeable in React, use that. If you are going to use Vue.js or Astro or any other framework. When you start with something and you can go with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it is a matter of discovering what the client needs and where the goals meet. How we can achieve it. And once we are very clear on that, you can start developing. And during the development phase itself, we can see what are the possible, you know, the bottlenecks or what causes the issue, what could be a problem, and we can figure out other different approaches and solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, for example, you don&#8217;t have to let&#8217;s say, PayPal is not the only payment provider right now, right? The payment gateway. So we are using so many different stuff and they do the payment integration quickly. But before those days, let&#8217;s say 10, 15 years ago that case was different, so now we have more options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So similarly, you don&#8217;t have to create a form and you don&#8217;t have to wait for someone to, the third party or some other open source in a package or something to be ready. So either you can build something on your own if you have time and budget, or you can fork something and then you can adjust to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or the other way is, I would say you can go with some existing third party or SaaS or any other solution, which is just already there and you can see how you can use it with WordPress. So these are the stuff that can reduce your development time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you say if you are, I don&#8217;t know exact hours or something, let&#8217;s say a thousand hours. So if you say a thousand hours for a normal WebPress installation, so headless may take a little longer, 1,500 or 2000 or anything. But it depends on what the client wants and what framework you choose and your expertise, like, I mean, the whole team&#8217;s expertise. And also how well we plan, organize, and go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So sometimes it&#8217;s like just the client takes so long to respond, or sometimes it&#8217;s just like, even the client is clueless or what&#8217;s happening. So that adds up to some stuff. And I would like to also highlight, when you hear all this stuff, somebody listening is, they will be scratching their head like, so headless is yay or nay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, recently, I cannot say the client name and stuff, but I would say, how we figured this out and how it is kind of helpful. So we had to publish more than 20 websites. That&#8217;s for a single client. And all of them are different, and all of them are headless, but that&#8217;s for a single parent company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what happened is, we had the architecture ready, right? So we, we know what happens when you publish. We have everything ready. I mean, the back end and the front end ready. So things become more easier that way. The development time is actually just for one site and then other sites, it&#8217;s just like, it was fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we had enough configuration and enough options we given to the client. So every site is not going to look exactly the same. They have their own customizations. But still it&#8217;s like amount of development time is the same or is actually less when you compare to traditional. But it depends. It depends on what&#8217;s the use case? How, what you are trying to build and everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it really does sound, there were so many good perspectives at the beginning where, you mentioned performance and so on where this is definitely going to be worth it. I guess if the client is willing and the budget is available and the expertise is there, then this sounds like an incredible option. Steep learning curve probably, but a lot of benefits on the backside of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lax, just before we round it up, if somebody has been thinking about playing with headless and they&#8217;ve listened to this and they think, okay, I&#8217;d like to take that a bit further. Couple of things, firstly, where can they get in touch with you? But also have you got any guidance about resources that they may find useful?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that could be a website or a book or whatever it may be. So let&#8217;s start off with resources and then we&#8217;ll turn to you to finish it off. So what resources do you recommend to learn about headless in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:49] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> In general it&#8217;s like you can start with WP Engine has their own blog. They have stuff about headless WordPress and they also have some of packages and stuff they maintain. They have Atlas. It&#8217;s a platform they are planning to go full fledged on headless stuff. And also you can read about GraphQL, WP GraphQL. Their team is more active and they share a ton of stuff on how to customize and maintain stuff with headless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also you can, like a shameless plug. So I&#8217;d also highlight about our WebDevStudios blog. So you can see a lot of headless related articles, tips, and tricks. If you want to play around like, you know, you don&#8217;t have to spend something to test it out. So you can go with a lot of free starter templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have, WDS has like WebDevStudios has a starter template. We have Next.js starter. So that&#8217;s a headless thing. All you need is your WordPress, and then you can install that on a locally in your laptop or machine, and then you can just test it out, how it looks, compare the performance and everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, like other developers and writers have their own stuff. Like Colby Fayock is a popular WordPress developer. He has his own Next.js starter. So you can just simply Google WordPress headless starter, and you can find a lot of starter templates. If you are a developer, go this route or if you are a, you know, site owner or you are just hobbyist, you want to just try or understand a little bit more?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can still do that reading the resources, right? You can actually check our blog as well. WebDevStudios blog. We have, I would say a couple of headless related stuff. That&#8217;s one of the popular article last year. Why headless WordPress is trending. So you can see why it is trending, what to expect. You can read more details in that blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you very much. And then finally, just to finish this off. Where could people get in touch with you? Are you available on social media? Maybe an email address? Whatever you&#8217;re comfortable with sharing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:50] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Sure. You can find me on, you know, Lax Mariappan. I&#8217;m on all the social media like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and everywhere you can find me. So you can reach out to me as an email as well, laxman.0903@gmail.com. Anywhere like GitHub everywhere is the same. Luckily I got my name on all the social media, so you can find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Lax Mariappan, thank you so much for chatting to me today. I really appreciate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:16] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Thanks Nathan. It&#8217;s been great. So I&#8217;ve been listening to WP Tavern Podcast for a while. Especially, I like to catch up with what&#8217;s going on. The new stuff with WordPress. So it&#8217;s good to be on the show,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, you are most welcome. It&#8217;s been a really interesting and informative episode. Cheers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:34] <strong>Lax Mariappan:</strong> Cheers. Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today, we have <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/laxmariappan/\">Lax Mariappan</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lax is a web developer based in the Philippines. He’s an Open Source enthusiast, and lover of all things WordPress. Lax has been tinkering with websites since high school, but it all changed when he discovered WordPress in 2010. Lax currently works as a Backend Engineer at <a href=\"https://webdevstudios.com/\">WebDevStudios</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk today about Headless WordPress, and it’s a complex topic. Headless is the concept of decoupling the WordPress admin from the frontend of the site. WordPress will continue to work as expected, but the presentation layer will be done by a different technology. React, Gatsby and Remix being some popular choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This implementation of WordPress is complex, requiring technical knowledge above and beyond that needed for a more typical WordPress install, but it has its benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lax talks through all of this in great detail. How keeping on top of all the additional dependencies Headless WordPress requires can be time consuming. How it can create difficulties for content editors who don’t always get to see what their work will actually look like in real time. Why this approach to WordPress can take more time and resources during the build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lax explains how these problems typically crop up, and how it’s possible to plan ahead and build in solutions for all the problems that you might encounter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever thought about going Headless with WordPress, then the podcast today is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React Library</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">Gatsby</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://remix.run/\">Remix</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://webdevstudios.github.io/nextjs-wordpress-starter/\">WebDevStudio Next.js WordPress Starter</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://graphql.org/\">GraphQL</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wpgraphql.com/\">WPGraphQL</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://webdevstudios.com/blog/\">WebDevStudio Blog</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.colbyfayock.com/\">Colby Fayock&#8217;s website</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 15:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Do The Woo Community: 95% of Websites Have an Issue with Color Contrast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=74180\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://dothewoo.io/color-contrast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:379:\"<p>Even just by getting your color contrast right, which is very easy, anyone can do it.

Although they are already developed as self-contained modules so they can be easily extracted as individual plugins, the concern is that their visibility would be greatly reduced. The Performance Lab plugin has more than 30,000 active installs. Any standalone plugin would take time to build up to a user base, whereas functionality added to Performance Lab has an instant audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Agreed that there are definitely valid use cases for stand alone plugins, remaining mindful of some of the advantages of a single hub plugin such as development/maintenance, adoption, promotion, developer onboarding/contribution etc. which the Performance Lab facilitates well today as a central performance focus community hub plugin,&#8221; Performance Team contributor Thierry Muller <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/12/20/help-us-test-the-sqlite-implementation/#comment-44231\">said</a> in response to the unbundling request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Muller outlined three different options contributors discussed in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/01/10/performance-team-meeting-summary-10-january-2023/\">this week&#8217;s Performance Team meeting</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<ul>\n<li>Option 1: Keep PL as is, but additionally&nbsp;deploy&nbsp;modules as individual plugins</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Option 2: Make PL a “wrapper” focused on central infrastructure and recommendation of individual plugins</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Option 3: Deprecate PL completely in favor of individual plugins</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Option 3 seems to be the least attractive to those who participated in this week&#8217;s discussion, as it introduces more hurdles for discoverability. Performance Team contributor Felix Arntz noted that one benefit of option 1 is the plugin would continue to work as-is for the 30K people who currently have it installed and that option 2 &#8220;would require a complex migration that users likely would not understand.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress developer Jonny Harris suggested that having each functionality in its own plugin helps with testing but also asked what defines a module.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Would the current Site Health checks all be together, for example?&#8221; Harris asked. &#8220;SQLite and WebP are clearly their own modules, but what about smaller things?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arntz suggested contributors continue the discussion regarding the scope of how the current modules could be distributed as plugins. He suggested every module could become its own plugin where some modules become standalone plugins and others would be grouped together into a few &#8220;topic specific&#8221; plugins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors are discussing the different approaches in more detail on a GitHub issue and will be <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/issues/618#issuecomment-1377598692\">voting on the best approach</a>. The vote will be open until Friday, January 20, 2023. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 03:34:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"HeroPress: Why small can be just the right choice\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=5014\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:150:\"https://heropress.com/essays/why-small-can-be-just-the-right-choice/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=why-small-can-be-just-the-right-choice\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7334:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/011023-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: WordPress has impacted where we live, who our friends are and which destinations we like to visit.\" />\nHere is Ellen reading her own story aloud.\n\n\n\n<p>I feel honoured to write an essay for HeroPress. While thinking about what I should write about, I wanted to make sure it will be helpful to others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, everyone&#8217;s goals are different. My partner Manuel and I started to create WordPress products, because we saw the opportunity to build a small business and keep it a business we both felt comfortable to work in over the years. And that&#8217;s what we did. We love to travel and searched for a way to live the nomad lifestyle long before the term was even a thing. We travelled and worked on our blog and themes. And don&#8217;t get me wrong, it was not easy in the beginning. We had to build an audience first, so we wrote blog posts about everything we learned while keeping financially afloat with small client projects. We put endless hours of work into our blog, before even dreaming of one day earning income just with our themes. But we loved every minute of it. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>We worked from Thailand, Sri Lanka and New Zealand, and we felt creative and free. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We went to WordCamps and creative conferences along the way and met so many new people with similar values and goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having these experiences formed our way of thinking about the way we wanted to work moving forward. The benefits of being a small team of two seemed so obvious to us. We could make decisions fast and react to new trends without asking anyone for permission. As long as we built something others liked, we would always be ok. So that&#8217;s what we focused on. We built one theme after the other and loved the creative freedom this work gave us. The positive feedback and listening to the stories our customers shared on how our themes helped them reach their goals kept us going.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-living-abroad\">Living abroad</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As we could work remotely from any location. We didn&#8217;t need an office or a local team. Keeping our business so flexible allowed us to move from Germany to New Zealand in 2015. After about two years working towards it, we were able to apply for a business visa and eventually for permanent residency four years later. Living away from family is never easy, but the opportunity to live in another country surely teaches us so many valuable lessons we would never want to miss. It&#8217;s a true gift, all made possible by our small WordPress business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-reacting-to-changes\">Reacting to changes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast-forward to 2018 and the WordCamp Tokyo, where we first got the chance to dig deeper into the Gutenberg project during contributor day. We knew changes were coming, and we needed to react with our business. Even before, we felt that building one theme after the other felt a bit tiresome and not like the most effective way for WordPress users to build their site design. We were never convinced by the page builder solutions, as it just seemed too bloated and untrue to WordPress core to bring a wow effect to us. We love to keep things flexible and minimal, and adding an entire framework on top of WordPress never felt like a great idea to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>So here comes this Gutenberg thing, a promise to a more flexible, component based way of creating designs for WordPress. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We felt like this is meant to be for us. So once home from the WordCamp we started to build blocks and explore how this new WordPress would work. We did not realize back then how big these changes would become and how much it would impact our work and our business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it felt good to build something new and to try to find a better solution to offer for our theme customers. We struggled to gain footage for quite some time, as there were just so many new technical things to figure out and so much was unclear. But we still never doubted that we are on the right track, as with every new release the opportunities seem to get better and more stable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just now we are just about to relaunch our business websites with a brand-new block theme that is solely built with our blocks, WooCommerce blocks and WordPress core blocks. It finally feels like all the work comes together and themes and the Gutenberg project are ready to be merged into one and released for production.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-opportunity-to-pivot\">Opportunity to pivot</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During all these changes, we had the time to think about the future of our WordPress business and what we want our road ahead to look like. Many others around us have sold their independent businesses or took a job at one of the big WordPress businesses. I feel like it&#8217;s also a natural path of WordPress and all of us growing up.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>For us, we feel like we are just getting started again, finally having found a way to have fun creating for WordPress again. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Building one of our last classic themes, we felt like we had lost the fun in designing for WordPress. We felt like themes were stuck, being either too inflexible and or way too bloated to be any good. It felt like we were trying to build, squeeze out a solution into a product that technically was never meant to be this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block themes, the site editor, patterns, and blocks come as a chance for us to do it better. It&#8217;s a big shift and a difficult project to pull off, for sure. WordPress is used by so many people in so many ways. But block themes make WordPress lighter, and they don&#8217;t stand in the way of other add-ons as much as classic themes felt they were. It&#8217;s amazing how we can take all the components apart and mix and match them together. There are still missing pieces, but we are getting there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For us, we are taking this shift that we are sort of making together with WordPress, as an opportunity to make things better. We always felt like we wanted to offer more support and help to our customers. But we never found the time. So with our upcoming relaunch, we are taking the chance to change that. We will offer new services and are exploring more ways to offer our customers what they actually need. It feels like a breath of fresh air to us, and we haven’t had so much fun with WordPress in a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>It&#8217;s funny, who would have thought that a piece of software can impact your life in such a big way. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has impacted where we live, who our friends are and which destinations we like to visit. We feel more open-minded because of WordPress, we believe in the power of open source projects and we believe that a group of people from all over the world can build something meaningful together.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/why-small-can-be-just-the-right-choice/\">Why small can be just the right choice</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 01:15:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Ellen Bauer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress is Turning 20: Let’s Celebrate!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=14155\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/01/wordpress-is-turning-20-lets-celebrate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1474:\"<p>2023 marks the 20th year of WordPress.

This event is open to WordPress users of all experience levels who are interested to learn more about how to use WordPress&#8217; layout features when building sites with blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Host Birgit Pauli-Haack will be joined by WordPress veterans Isabel Brison, Andrew Serong, and Justin Tadlock. Brison will be demonstrating different layout scenarios during the presentation, and attendees will be able to participate with questions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any user who has attempted to layout a design in WordPress has likely tried out container blocks that offer layout settings. These blocks include Columns, the Cover block, and the generic Group block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event will cover how to manipulate layouts by defining the width of post content, arranging blocks horizontally or vertically, right or left aligned, and inside container blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In terms of block styling, Layout is a complex feature because it affects child blocks in ways that go beyond CSS inheritance,&#8221; Pauli-Haack said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 introduced more layout controls and flexibility in the block editor, but Pauli-Haack said the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/updated-editor-layout-support-in-6-1-after-refactor/\">dev note on updated layout support</a> was written more for developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Feedback from users through the FSE program and other connections revealed that handling the layout settings for container blocks is not particularly intuitive and takes some trial and error to find the right combination,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The Live Q &amp; A will bring a better understanding to users and #nocode site builders.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Pauli-Haack started the Live Q &amp; A&#8217;s in 2018, she routinely brought in guests who were building the block editor, with the intention of having users meet them and discuss features like full-site editing, block themes, case studies, and discuss challenges. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since then, quite a few initiatives of the official WordPress project have come to life,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There is the highly successful Full Site Editing outreach program, spearheaded by Anne McCarthy, who now holds regular Hallway Hangouts with community members and contributors.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>People are also learning the ins and outs of site editing through the efforts of the training team, which began creating courses and lesson plans and hosting workshops on Meetup.com in 2021. These are also recorded and uploaded to WordPress.tv and YouTube. WordPress.org also <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-launches-developer-blog-in-beta\">launched a blog for developers</a> in November 2022. With all these new learning opportunities, Pauli-Haack is changing the focus for her live events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For the Gutenberg Times Live Q &amp; As, I am now looking at topics and discussions about more complex concepts, more case studies, and technology on the cutting edge,&#8221; she said. Most recently, the show <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/live-q-a-block-first-approach-at-pew-research-center/\">featured the developers and digital strategies of the Pew Research Center</a>, a high profile site that was built with a block-first approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are also in planning phase to hold a Live Q &amp; A with the developers of GiveWP who are using Gutenberg as a framework to build the next generation of their popular donations plugin with the components and scripts that Gutenberg uses, but outside the post or site editor,&#8221; Pauli-Haack said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also has another Live Q &amp; A planned with the WordPress VIP design team that works on design systems for companies that need a streamlined way to stay within their design standards.

It is the software magic where we discover what new things we can do each day, how to make ideas become reality, and how we might leverage what we learn to create a better world.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ripple effect of inclusion: </strong>When you provide the ability for a large group of people to participate, travel, and network, the impact extends beyond the WordPress community to create the bigger changes we want to see in the world. This is our community magic.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fifth Freedom in WordPress</strong>: We are all familiar with The Four Freedoms of WordPress. This is the 5th &#8211; full participation. Removing the financial barrier will bring us closer to the reality of being a truly inclusive community.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-container-10 wp-block-columns sponsor has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"Gravity-Forms\">\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-column\">\n<h3><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Episode Partner: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/gravity\">Gravity Forms</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://poststat.us/gravity\">Gravity Forms</a></strong> is a powerful form builder for WordPress and the #1 choice for businesses and web professionals across the globe.

I&#8217;m with a good friend of mine when Winstina hughes. I met with Winstina a couple years ago in the post status community. We&#8217;ve got to meet in person, talk numerous times, and, um, I&#8217;m excited about what we&#8217;re gonna be talking about here. Um, she&#8217;s got a new, a project called support inclusion in tech.com and we&#8217;re gonna dive into that today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, uh, hi, Winstina. Hi. And pumped to finally have you on,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> I&#8217;m excited to be with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Could you tell us what you do in WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> Okay. Um, What do I do in WordPress? every time I speak with, you know, every time I have one of these, um, you know, opportunities to speak with someone in the community, I end up like re repeating the question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, cuz it really helps me. I am a community member, um, and I&#8217;m also, you know, a, an organizer, um, a meetup organizer and a board camp organizer. I started, um, going to [00:01:00] meetups in New York City and I transitioned into, Speaking, um, at Word Camp, New York City, and then I was invited to become a meetup organizer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, um, my, you know, my participation in the community was, um, you know, like in the early, um, you know, 2010s. And then around 2015, 2016, um, I started, you know, speaking at, at New York City, and then I became an organizer. I meet up organizer. In 2018, I led my first word camp and my only word, camp , hundred twenties, um, a budget of 120,000, a team of 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, it was an amazing experience. They were wonderful people and it was. Really tiring .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. You know, over the years, Winstina, I&#8217;ve had so many dear friends that have been Word Camp organizers and really I go, oh my God, I love you so much because of what you&#8217;re doing for the community. But I also go, I hope you [00:02:00] still like word this afterwards because it&#8217;s a such a labor of love that I think, um, so often we don&#8217;t really give the credit and thanks to the people, That do this voluntarily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, like you&#8217;re talking about all the stuff you&#8217;re done. So anyway, I wanna say thank you because I&#8217;ve said it so many times to dear friends over the years going, thank you for what you&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;ve always shied away from it because it&#8217;s so much work and I see all the passion and energy that you and other organizers have and I&#8217;m really thankful cuz I think that is so critical to the entire community to have these, and now we&#8217;re talking in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we hear WordCamps are back. You and I got to see each other in San Diego at Word Camp US. Yes, yes, yes. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> anyway, so Word, word camp Us. I was a co-organizer for Word Camp US this year. Um, and so yeah, you&#8217;re right. Like we had a chance to teach other again there, and that was like, yay. That was awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> It was, yeah.[00:03:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. A absolutely. Well, okay, so what drew you to, okay, how did you start with WordPress? Were you using WordPress for, uh, your own website, somebody else&#8217;s website? How&#8217;d you get started with the actual software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> So I started with WordPress in 2006, 2007. Um, I had a college course that was . Yeah, I, I had a college course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and our professor required us to add, um, you know, the work that we&#8217;d done, uh, into a wordpress.com blog. Um, it was a geographic information systems class. And, uh, we were looking at public health data at the census block level. Um, and so we were actually, you know, looking to see. You know, where, um, there were instances of like, um, I don&#8217;t wanna say disease, but you know, like different illnesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so what what&#8217;s really interesting is that you can, that schools get access to that data and you can actually like, You can [00:04:00] essentially imagine, and I don&#8217;t wanna go too far deep into it, but imagine you have like, you know, Google Maps, right? And like when you have Google Maps open, you can do street view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Google Maps lets you like go from that whole, um, like that map into like street view where you jump in as a person. So, uh, this data essentially took you away from just the geographic element, um, and the typography and like really. The census, you know, track level, like essentially, um, you know, looking at neighborhoods and, you know, the instances of disease in those neighborhoods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so he, you know, he gave that to us as our final assignment. Um, you know, we did some like, uh, some heat mapping to show where there were greater concentrations of a particular type of illness, , right. Um, or, um, you know, disease or, you know, Uh, I&#8217;m not exactly sure like what, what we [00:05:00] were calling it, but that&#8217;s what our assignment was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, he asked us to, you know, take like a picture of the map and to post it in wordpress.com and that&#8217;s how it all started with that , with that assignment. Um, so we were you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> We were using WordPress at the same time. That&#8217;s the same year I started with WordPress when you started. I did not know you went that, that far back with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I love that. Uh, yeah, I do. Thank you. And then you said like in 2010 you started actually, uh, getting involved with community events. And this is relevant to us talking about support, inclusion and tech. So what drew you to start participating in volunteering and contributing to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> So I went to New York City Meetups, um, and, uh, WordPress, New York City, uh, is the one that&#8217;s in closest proximity to where I lived.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could just take the train in. Um, and it was, it was great. Like I, I really felt, um, that the community there was, was [00:06:00] open, like the organizers were open and, and they were welcoming. Um, Dana, rendy, uh, those were organizers at the time, Steve Bruner, who was an organizer. Was he is the organizer, , he started it and he&#8217;s, he&#8217;s kept it, you know, um, really like strong, like, since its inception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and so like just going to these events and meeting these, these like wonderful generous people, these kind people, um, you know, meeting Kevin Cre, Christiana there as well. Um, and you know, just that environ. Was what led me to continue attending events. Um, and they really encouraged me to submit a talk to speak at New York City, um, ward Camp, New York City.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I submitted a talk to speak there and, you know, since that time I&#8217;ve been more engaged in. Event organizing component, [00:07:00] um, or part of the community. So it moved beyond just, you know, um, Like learning, you know, to use Word Pro, you know, building sites and breaking them, uh, the best, right? Yeah. Like, that&#8217;s the best way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the only way you can really learn. I mean, I, I started, you know, with different hosting plans, I&#8217;ve had like four or five, like I have multiple domains. Like I think when you&#8217;re in our space, you got a chance to really create. And, um, and that&#8217;s what I was able to do and what I&#8217;m able to continue doing, and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now moved from just creating and building with WordPress to assisting with supporting, you know, our community through events like meetups and, uh, word camp organizing and supporting inclusion in tech is, is an extension of, um, of this work, this contribution that I&#8217;ve been doing. It, it, it pieces together so many different elements that I&#8217;ve come to, like I&#8217;ve come to see and I&#8217;ve come to understand [00:08:00] and. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a solution that I propose to, um, some current challenges that, um, I&#8217;ve heard being expressed. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I, uh, I wanna scroll back for a second and say that when you&#8217;re talking about create, I sometimes it, for as long as you and I have been in WordPress sometimes forget that magic of being able to create something on the web or in the, in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See this cool tool called WordPress, so I appreciate that. I think that&#8217;s what we rally around in the WordPress community and particularly to post status is helping build tools and projects and things on top of this magical thing we call WordPress. So that was a, when you said create, I was like, it&#8217;s just little tingle of magic came up of that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s why we, I think that&#8217;s our common bond in</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I agree. I agree. And I think that, uh, when we create as community members, um, and not necessarily [00:09:00] just as. Business owners or, or, um, you know, those who are providing like services. That&#8217;s a component of creating. But, you know, in the middle of doing all that, I think, you know, I mean, I like to sit down and just literally play and see, you know, what could I do with it today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and, um, I entered a com competition, um, held by Sustainable New Jersey, um, right around the time I completed graduate school. And there were municipalities that were seeking, um, solutions for challenges that they had. And there was the city of East Orange and they wanted like a marketplace, um, and a place for their planning department to, you know, add their documents and also something for their green team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I saw this, I was like, I could use WordPress and e-commerce. So I created like a WooCommerce marketplace for them to sell, you know, for residents that would sell their products and services. And I demoed it. Um, and then I also had a website and also a Buddy press site. Um, and the buddy press site would be for their green team members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that [00:10:00] like, when, when we create with WordPress, like we&#8217;re able to like see like, you know, These asks and really apply like our knowledge of what we know the c m s can do and then provide a solution. And the city was actually really happy with the solution. Um, and I made it to the finals of the competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but there was another, uh, but there were other teams that that won it. Um, but it was, it was really exciting to show what WordPress, you know, software and what WooCommerce can. Uh, that&#8217;s the</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> dream. Um, that, that&#8217;s so awesome. Thank you for sharing that backstory. As much as we&#8217;ve talked and stuff, I haven&#8217;t got the chance to ask those questions and, um, it&#8217;s a good reminder for me about, you know, I think if you go long enough in the community, you start to, well, I, I&#8217;ll say I start to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forget some of these nuances, [00:11:00] like being able to go, here&#8217;s a project idea, this could be done in WordPress, you know? And that the tools are mostly freely available. Yes. And you can start and build something online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> Exactly. Yeah. You just, you know, download . Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So that leads me to support inclusion and tech. And you mentioned you saw a problem or problems and challenges in our community that you wanted to help make some a solution to toward it that became support, inclusion and tech. But can you talk about that a little bit? Cause I know my, my understanding and you continue to help me expand my understanding of all this is it&#8217;s not just one particular country with DEI, it&#8217;s a global thing. But could you talk a little bit about the problems and challenges that you saw in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> Absolutely. Um, absolutely. So I, you know, really wanna, like, I wanna hold true to like, um, to how [00:12:00] I, um, shared it on my website. Um, but really the backstory is that. There was a conversation that erupted on Twitter, um, about the need for more diversity on Word Camp, um, organizing teams. And this started, uh, due to, um, you know, uh, some, some thoughts that were expressed about Word Camp Europe, uh, where WordCamp Europe&#8217;s organizing team, um, not being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very reflective, um, of, you know, more ethnicities or a wider range of them. Um, it was a really difficult conversation that was happening. And my take on it really is that it&#8217;s not where camp you&#8217;re specific, right? Like, I mean, let&#8217;s, you know, let&#8217;s really step back and think about the fact that, you know, there&#8217;s so many ethnicities around the world that have a ch [00:13:00] like it&#8217;s really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re in the minority as a group, Really up to the group that&#8217;s in the majority to weave you into those experiences and those opportunities. Um, and when that doesn&#8217;t happen, then you have groups that don&#8217;t have an opportunity to be, to participate and to be involved and, you know, support inclusion and tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, considering this was a conversation about word camps and our participation in them. Support, inclusion and tech really seeks to assist us in solving the challenge of, um, not having as much, you know, ethnic or, um, or just diverse representation within the Word camp experience. It doesn&#8217;t seek to, you know, um, it doesn&#8217;t, it doesn&#8217;t seek, you know, to like solve, um, Like these, you know, the world that we [00:14:00] live in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it doesn&#8217;t seek to solve like, um, you know, diversity and inclusion outside of the WordPress space. Um, but I believe that in, in providing these, um, these opportunities within our community, since we&#8217;re so large, that the ripple effects can extend well beyond the WordPress community. I believe that when you, Absolut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you provide such a large group of people, the ability to, um, to participate in work camps, um, the ability to travel to them, the ability to network to them with, when you attend, um, the ability to like, you know, seek, um, you know, out more relationships, friendships, professional relationships. Then there&#8217;s this ripple that extends outside of our community and I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That level of empowerment can extend outside of WordPress and those ripples can assist us in diversity inclusion beyond, [00:15:00] um, you know, our, our involvement in WordPress. But you know, this, this particular solution is intended to solve the challenge that I saw, you know, um, being expressed, you know, within our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the thought is really, Since, you know, since there&#8217;s a take on it. And there&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a, I mean, it&#8217;s an, it&#8217;s an honest one, right? We don&#8217;t see enough people of color. We don&#8217;t see, um, enough, you know, people of, um, other minority groups, um, you know, uh, from other parts of the world. Um, You know, we are seeing an equal, more equal balance of, um, men and women.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, you know, but when it extends beyond that into like, you know, more representation in terms of like, you know, a wide range of religions, which ties to ethnicity often. Um, and when you&#8217;re looking at representation in terms of those of us who, um, have like neuro [00:16:00] diversion, you know, um, you know, like, uh, characteristics and those of us who, um, you know, who we choose to love, , you know, the what society, um, you know, asks of us , right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, and um, and when we choose to hold true to that or when we&#8217;re dealing with the physical limitations, um, that, you know, that we were born with or when we&#8217;re in minority. Groups, you know, that have a harder time, you know, uh, receiving opportunities, um, to participate and to increase, you know, their reach and even, um, you know, the professional opportunities that are available to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, like this. What can we do to, um, to really like solve. To solve that. Mm-hmm. And I thought, what could I do within our community Yep. To, you know, to integrate, you know, like all of those of us who are, um, Either, you know, disadvantaged [00:17:00] or not as represented into WordPress programming and support, inclusion and tech, um, seeks to, you know, take away that financial barrier, which I believe is really what, you know, can limit our participation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to participate, we want to speak, but if we can&#8217;t afford to speak , right? I mean, if we can&#8217;t afford to travel to the conference and if we can&#8217;t afford a place to stay at the conference, um, then. Like, why would we even think to apply to speak at the conference? Right? Like,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> yeah. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s really beautiful, Winston, because, um, there&#8217;s a couple of takeaways I, I got from this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one is, I, I&#8217;ve always believed, um, at least in my world, that WordPress has been. The, an inclusive place, ever growing inclusive community. That&#8217;s like a mirror to my world, the way I want my physical world here in Oklahoma to be. And I have [00:18:00] so much learned from our community leadership, uh, over the years, um, that there&#8217;s a cons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistent push and drive from the entire community and the leadership to be truly diverse, truly inclusive in all those words. And I, I learn a lot from this. Um, so the mirror I, and I do think WordPress is, our community is so powerful cuz we&#8217;re distributed all over the world. So if we make change in our community, in our WordPress, That should be, that should be reflected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s another, we talked about the software magic. This is the community magic. Exactly. Uh, the other thing is, I, I love and I respect because I try to take too much on that, you said, Hey, here&#8217;s something I&#8217;m passionate about, being an organizer, being at these community events, how special and valuable they are to you and other people instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna make this dent first. Yeah. Like, I&#8217;m gonna, I&#8217;m gonna take on this aspect first. You. Beautifully and clearly [00:19:00] shared. This is the thing I&#8217;m trying to take on in this bigger, bigger, um, change that you wanna see. We wanna see in the world. Thank you. Okay, so we&#8217;ve got this now we&#8217;ve got a website. Um, you&#8217;ve got a website up to kind of share this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now. Take me through, if you would, I am, pretend for a second you&#8217;re talking to someone that is in an underrepresented, uh, in, in tech. Of, um, situation. Mm-hmm. , how&#8217;s the process to, to get on the, Hey, I want to go to these WordCamps. I want to speak, but I do need some assistance. What does that process look like for, for support inclusion and tech?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> So support, inclusion and tech. Um, also weaves into other initiatives in order to, to assist our speakers. Um, and so when you&#8217;re accepted, support inclusion tech, it become, moves into the position to, to assist you once you&#8217;re accepted into [00:20:00] Word Camp. Um, as soon as you get that, you know, acceptance, you know, go to https://supportinclusionintech.com/.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and you&#8217;re simply just, you know, gonna put in the word camp that you were accepted in. And then there are two components, um, in addition that they&#8217;re suggested , right? Like you&#8217;re encouraged to do this. Um, you know, uh, we&#8217;re in the community of consent and so, um, you have, you know, um, You&#8217;re gonna give, you know, the consent to be included in these other initiatives, um, you&#8217;re not gonna be forced into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, there&#8217;s underrepresented in tech and there&#8217;s also the WordPress diversity, speaker channel. Um, both of those, uh, are ways of. Further supporting diversity and inclusion and representation within the WordPress space and creating, you know, um, you know, successful opportunities for us to, um, to, you know, to put together great speaker applications and then to also, um, you know, move beyond just submitting [00:21:00] them. Um, but to being accepted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The, the ask is that, you know, once you&#8217;ve been accepted to camp and you&#8217;re starting the process of, you know, receiving funding through supporting inclusion and tech, that you also participate in those other two initiatives as well. Um, because you know, in the process of doing that, it&#8217;s further supporting the work that we&#8217;re doing in the WordPress community. Exactly as you said, Corey, that, you know, the word WordPress leadership already has been putting in, um, you know, the work to, you know, to assist us in resolving the challenges that face society as a whole. And so there are initiatives that currently exist and those two in particular, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, are ways that we can continue to support underrepresented minority groups in the WordPress community. Um, and so in the process of, you know, uh, applying for the funding, uh, you&#8217;re encouraged to, you know, to list yourself on underrepresented tech to join the, um, the, the diversity speaker channel [00:22:00] on make WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and then once you&#8217;ve just put on, put that information in and you&#8217;ve identified the type of support that you&#8217;re seeking, um, you just like, and it starts from there. Like I start, um, you know, pairing you with, you know, with a partner that you know can, can step in and provide, you know, the funding for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, you know, they&#8217;re gonna cover your travel and they&#8217;re gonna cover your hotel. Um, and that way in order for you to participate, you&#8217;re not going to be paying anything really that you know, out of pocket. For that participation, um, in that WordCamp. And that&#8217;s really the goal. Um, the goal is to remove the financial barrier to your participation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s fantastic. By the way, I wanted to sidebar for a second and say underrepresented in tech, uh, by Allie and Michelle Frechette. If, if you&#8217;re listening to this and, uh, you also as a be becoming a member of underrepresented in tech, get a free [00:23:00] uh, professional membership at post status?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> Yes. Yes. I started, I and let&#8217;s not also forget too, that like there are other opportunities as well as Post Status has been, um, you know, looking into as ways of increasing, you know, diversity and representation within the Post Status community. Um, so underrepresented tech and that membership, and I know that there&#8217;s some other ways that you&#8217;re working on it too, Corey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, I think, I think when we can pull all our efforts together. We have a stronger community. Um, and you are, you know, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re offering that and then supporting inclusion and tech, you know, encouraging, you know, speakers to, to register and to participate in those two other programs. Strengthen all our efforts. Yes. Um, and, and that&#8217;s, you know, that&#8217;s the process of it. And so once you&#8217;ve submitted, you know, your. once you submitted that form, you know, just letting me know, like the speaker registration that you&#8217;re seeking, the [00:24:00] support. Um, you&#8217;re also gonna complete the blind directory listing and that blind directory really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That Blind directory listing has the word camp that you&#8217;ll be speaking at. Um, and it has the type of support that you&#8217;re seeking, whether it&#8217;s just beach travel or hotel, or both, and that&#8217;s it. Um, no one in the community, um, you know, needs to know who you are. They don&#8217;t need to know what your need is. Um, they don&#8217;t need to know where you come from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they don&#8217;t need to know what makes you underrepresented and what makes you a diverse speaker. Uh, it&#8217;s simply a way for, um, for companies that are considering sponsoring to see that the need does exist. And it&#8217;s also a way for our community to see that the need does exist, um, and that we do have members that are seeking the support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that, that blind directory listing is, is just a way, you know, for our community to see that, um, that our need is there. Um, yeah, and it&#8217;s also a way of, um, uh, [00:25:00] keeping everyone up to date on the work that&#8217;s happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So I know we&#8217;ll have two asks. The first ask is if, um, you need assistance, want assistance to go to a WordCamp to be sure to go to supportinclusionintech.com?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> Yes. Once you&#8217;ve been accepted, go to supportinclusionintech.com. Complete the form for speaker registration, and you&#8217;ll, um, you&#8217;ll be paired currently, um, with four companies, uh, that, um, that have partnered to work on this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> That comes to our second ask. Yeah, that&#8217;s right. Okay. So tell me how, um, now this is very relevant for post status because we&#8217;re a bunch of professional and business members in our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the second ask is, we need someone, one, participants, people that need and want assistance go and speak at Word Camps. And the second part of this is the sponsors and partners. Can you tell me a little bit more, more about that and [00:26:00] how that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> Okay, so starting off, partners are sponsors, , um, partners are the first, um, you know, companies that expressed an interest in supporting this project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, this initiative. Uh, and so like that is my way of thanking you, um, by, you know, by acknowledging. that you came into this, um, wholehearted and opened armed. And so thank you to the four companies, um, that have done this, uh, that have stepped forward to say that they will support. Um, you know, it was really exciting once the call went out, um, from Word Camp US that they were seeking, uh, support for underrepresented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speakers. It was really exciting because Master wp, um, stepped in at that time, you know, to say that they thought that this was a great project. And, you know, they&#8217;re the fourth company they joined, um, GoDaddy, Post Status, and Yoast, um, you know, the original three that said that, you know, that they would love to support this initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, um, now we have, [00:27:00] we have four of them and there are also several companies as well that are providing in-kind donations. Um, and, you know, they&#8217;re doing so, makes it possible for support, inclusion and tech, um, you know, to, to function, right? Because like, you have the website and then there are all these different like plugins that make it functional and make it possible, you know, for, um, for, for it to run and function the way that we need to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so if your company that wants to. Sponsor speakers, you know, you just have to go to the site. Um, there is a section there for you to register your support, um, your register, your desire to support. It&#8217;ll ask you, um, you know, to provide, you know, like a contact. Um, it&#8217;ll ask you the type of, uh, How you want to provide this support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, would you prefer to reimburse speakers for their expenses or are you, um, ready and, you know, willing and able to pay for their, um, their travel and their hotel in advance of their trip? [00:28:00] Um, so, you know, once you&#8217;ve identified your contact, you know, your contact is the type of support that you want to provide, you know, then, you know, we&#8217;ll have an opportunity, I&#8217;ll have an opportunity, you know, to really. Sit down with you and for us to have a conversation about like, you know what would be your process, you know, what would make it easy or for you to be a part of this initiative? Um, this isn&#8217;t a cookie cutter means of support for, for companies, because you&#8217;re all different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, how GoDaddy, you know, is providing support is different from how Post Status is providing support is different from how Yoss is providing support. And it&#8217;s different from, you know, how, um, Master WP is and, uh, When I started this, and I, you know, I, and I wrote on my blog, like, really this proposal on https://winstinahughes.com/.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I went into it, um, you know, with the understanding, personal understanding is that it&#8217;s gonna [00:29:00] take a couple years to understand the needs of our community and the ways, you know, companies and our ecosystem can support these needs. And in the last six months, Exactly what I, you know, anticipated, um, is what I&#8217;ve been able to, you know, to, to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, currently, um, there have been three, you know, requests, um, for, you know, to participate, you know, um, for funding, for support, for camps and, um, two unique, you know, individuals have, have made those requests. Um, and you know, so right now it&#8217;s a question of. You know, like assisting them, you know, with the process of how, you know, our four partners, you know, can support them in that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I think that answers part of your question. Um, the second part of the question is like, so how is this financial component gonna work? Right? [00:30:00] Like, are companies giving me money? No, you&#8217;re not , like, I&#8217;m not receiving, you know, um, any of the money. Is the financial support that you&#8217;re providing. Um, instead it&#8217;s looking at your company&#8217;s processes, um, you know, your, your financial processes, your accounting processes for you to, you know, step back and think like, how could we as a company provide this level of support?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, it could be that you already have an existing program. Yoast already has a diversity fund. Um, and so Yoast partnering with me is a way of, um, you know, kind of bringing the need that exists to them as well. Um, and so therefore they&#8217;re able to like further serve the community, um, you know, through those who are expressing an interest through support inclusion and tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, the way Post Status, you know, is seeking the support speakers too, is different from Yoast. Um, and, you know, uh, [00:31:00] Yoast has a budget, um, and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has their own system and their own ways of support. Um, and so they also have a budget and then Master wp, they also have a budget. And so once that budget has been met, then you know the partners essentially gray out for that year. Um, and they become active the next year. Um, and so. , that is a way of making this sustainable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you, you pledge how much you can support, um, speakers financially, and once that has been met, then your, I mean, your capacity for the year is, is, is met. And then next year, once you&#8217;ve reallocated your budget, or not re reallocated, but once you&#8217;ve defined, you know, your budget, um, for the year, then you would go, you know, back into the process of supporting [00:32:00] speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> And I wanted to say from personal experience here, that there&#8217;s many way, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s creative ways to support these speakers, uh, to go, you know, uh, you, you talked about hotel and flights. Yeah. And, um, I, I wanna, I wanted to say that one standard to say this is not an unapproachable. Opportunity to support d uh, diversity inclusion in tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, this is very manageable for most members at Post Status, by the way. So, you know, flight costs, uh, depending on where it is in the world. Um, I think the first question you asked me was, what&#8217;s your budget? Yeah. And that&#8217;s a great way. So as you come in and click sponsor, just be thinking of these things with when st for how you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Help support this amazing project. Um, and that there&#8217;s creative ways to do that. And I, I think Winstina, most members, business members at Post Status can make a meaningful contribution in this way [00:33:00] through this, your project here. And I love the fact also, I know we talked about this too, you wanted to be real careful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You wanna say you want the support to go to the person as best as possible. A lot of nonprofits have overhead. You have graciously generated your time and your talent to this project, and I, I, I love the way you&#8217;ve done it too, even though I go, gosh, Winston, I love that you have this passion. Um, but thank you so much for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I know you give of your own time. For this particular project, but as you talk to Ena, if you&#8217;re listening to this now, there&#8217;s creative options and ENA is so good at helping you, helping understand where you&#8217;re at, and then pair it with people that need assistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> Thank you. Yes, and that is, that is the goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of my contribution to the WordPress community, burnout is so real and because of the fact that I work full-time outside of the WordPress space, the WordPress ecosystem, um, I&#8217;m really [00:34:00] cognizant of the fact that I need to perform well. And at a high level , right? Uhhuh , um, at work, you know, and in my personal life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And WordPress fits into, um, you know, into that. And so I&#8217;ve been able to contribute in different capacities since I was in college and. Graduate school, first attending in college, um, or post-college in graduate school, moving into speaking and organizing, um, and now working, you know, professionally maintaining, you know, organizing as a meetup organizer and a WordCamp organizer, and understanding that this can really lead to burnout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, um, my ultimate decision is, you know, that for the next two years, I&#8217;m not gonna be a WordCamp speaker, and I&#8217;m also not gonna be a. Organizer, you know, this, these are the ways that I can, you know, I can continue to contribute. I can contribute through support, inclusion and tech. Um, you know, but really pair, pair down all the other ways that I could burn out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:00] And so by maintaining, Being a New York City meetup organizer and hosting at least a minimum of six meet meetups a year, and, um, really pivoting and concentrating my energy towards support, inclusion and tech. I can sustainably contribute to the community. And so this is a perfect opportunity to really share with you, um, that, you know, I want to meet with every speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, that expresses the interest for support. So as you submit your, you know, your speaker registration and you join the directory listing, I will, um, you know, I&#8217;ll ask to meet with you, for us to have a conversation, for me to understand your needs and to share. what it is I understand and I&#8217;ve learned over time, and also how our partners seek to support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ll have that conversation. It&#8217;s gonna be on the weekend. I hope you graciously incorporate that into your schedule. Um, because, you know, I, I work during the week, [00:36:00] um, and so, you know, we&#8217;ll meet once. Uh, hopefully within a week or two of your registering as soon as possible. Especially it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s ideal, uh, not ideal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s encouraged to register as soon as possible, um, because the closer you get to your ward camp, you&#8217;re gonna. Most likely, um, be reimbursed if you apply much sooner, like a, like two or three months in advance. You know, there are companies that will be able to, you know, cover your, your, your costs, um, of participation in advance of your trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are reaching out like three to two. You know, to the time of, of your support that the time that you need, then you&#8217;re looking at being reimbursed for your expenses. And so like, you know, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s something to, to keep in mind when it comes to registering, you know, for this is that companies will be able to assist you with removing this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It just might be [00:37:00] later. When your need is expressed closer to the time that you&#8217;re speaking that it&#8217;s more, it&#8217;ll be a reimbursement instead. Um, and so that&#8217;s something to keep in mind, the timing in which you submit your interest, and also the fact that, um, you know, that we&#8217;ll be meeting on a weekend. Um, there&#8217;s this speaker that just registered and he wanted to meet with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, On Christmas, he&#8217;s in another part of the world. I mean, you know, like, so yeah. Um, and so I just, you know, I just like, I think when, and I had a con, you know, I just like responded and let him know that it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s Christmas for me. I&#8217;m, you know, I&#8217;m a Christian and I&#8217;m so celebrating my holiday today. Um, you know, and, you know, like, uh, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s meet next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so, you know, uh, we&#8217;ll have like, you know, we&#8217;ll have these conversations and we&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll see. And you know how. Um, you know, how you and I can, can have that conversation and [00:38:00] meet and how your need can be met. And I&#8217;ll also meet with, you know, companies that wanna sponsor as well. And I wanna tell you, I want you to tell me what&#8217;s realistic for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I want just, just to, just to give you a sense of how some of the companies are. In fact, um, you have, uh, of the four partner. You have one partner who seeks to provide support, um, you know, within the us. Um, as of our last conversation, you know, the desire is to support minority speakers, um, specifically people of color, um, specifically, you know, black Americans, um, to improve or those of black descent to improve, um, their numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamps in the US. Um, our last conversation was, you know, this is the direction that they wanna go. This is the greatest impact that they think that they can achieve. Um, and [00:39:00] I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m so glad that I get to listen to what everyone. Hopes to do, you know? Um, because it gives me a sense too that our community is really thinking through, like, this is how we&#8217;re gonna solve it, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, this is how we&#8217;re gonna make the dent that we wanna see. So this company already knows this is how we&#8217;re gonna make the dent that we wanna see. And there, there. Process too, is that they&#8217;re just gonna give you a blanket amount of money and they&#8217;re not gonna micromanage how it is you spend it. Um, they just simply ask, you know, that you, not simply, the requirement is that you put it towards your WordCamp experience and that&#8217;s where they are with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there&#8217;s, you know, another company host of course, has an established diversity fund and they have processes already in place for the support. And so you&#8217;re simply gonna go through the existing process that, um, Yoast has established and they have a generous fund. Um, and their support, um, is something [00:40:00] that they&#8217;ve been offering the support for a long time, and they&#8217;re very, um, they&#8217;re really respected , you know, for that effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, I&#8217;ve had an opportunity to like, you know, to speak with someone who has been a part of their support in the past or received it and they speak so highly of, of Yoast um, and that&#8217;s, you know, Yoast has already thought it through and they&#8217;ve already walked through. You know, Corey and I, you and I have spoken about, you know, the budget, you know, that you&#8217;re, that post status is set aside and, and you&#8217;ve already shared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, what is the need? Like, we&#8217;re not micromanaging, right? Like, let us know what type of support that you need, and we&#8217;re just gonna provide that to you. Um, and so like you&#8217;re, you are already thinking about like, how can we make this happen? Like, you know, if you need to, you know, it&#8217;s a flight, you know, wherever it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be domestic, right? Like, it doesn&#8217;t have to be in the us it could be anywhere in the world. Um, and, and that&#8217;s, you know, that&#8217;s like, [00:41:00] Post Status is thinking, and then GoDaddy is currently working through their process. Um, and I do believe that because of the fact that they have teams around the world that GoDaddy&#8217;s reach will also be of, um, I think GoDaddy&#8217;s reach will also extend beyond like the domestic, you know, like within the US and they&#8217;ll be able to provide support as well toward camps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>you know, around the world. I&#8217;m anticipating it&#8217;s possible that, um, GoDaddy&#8217;s like impact could, you know, be especially strong with, um, Uh, WordCamps, like Word Camp Asia or Word Camp US or Word Camp Europe. Um, you know, because they&#8217;ll have team members there and when they have team members there that can help facilitate and smooth the process over for, for those that they&#8217;re going to be supporting, but they&#8217;re working through their processes to make this established as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think [00:42:00] that, you know, just by me sharing that, you can tell that, you know, each of, you know, my partners are, are working within. Um, you know, like their business processes and their financial processes and also their vision for impact. Um, and I think that&#8217;s really important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So to recap, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve heard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So support inclusion and tech.com is the bridge between those that want have the desire to share their exper experience and expertise at word camps, but need some financial assistance to get their flights and hotel. That&#8217;s what f support inclusion and tech.com does. Second, as a participant, as someone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, if you first need to apply and get, uh, approved to speak at work camp, then come to support inclusion and tech.com and, um, sign up, have a conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> Mm-hmm. , once you&#8217;ve been approved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Have a conversation with we, Tina. [00:43:00] And then third, the third recap is our ask for, um, well buzzer asked in our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, if you&#8217;re looking to speak to Word Camp, go to support inclu or go apply, get approved, come to support inclusion in tech. And then second for those businesses out there. You know, you have a heart, you wanna support this. That&#8217;s our community. That&#8217;s who WordPress is. Uh, go to support inclusion and tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click on the sponsor link and have a conversation with ena. Think about your budget. Think about what you wanna do, uh, when Cena is so creative in helping just make these connections happen so you can really make a difference in our community. Did I get it all right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> You did. You did get it right And, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that support inclusion tech also. It goes through vetting process as well to confirm that those who are seeking assistance, you know, to participate actually have been accepted. And that&#8217;s why, that&#8217;s why the steps are what they are. Um, partners aren&#8217;t gonna [00:44:00] question, oh, is this need real? You know, that vetting is gonna happen in advance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you receive a speaker interest, You know that this is someone who has been accepted a Word camp, and they understand the process and they&#8217;re working within, you know, your, your policies and your procedures, um, in order for them to participate. So it removes all those questions. Um, you know, so that and that, yeah, that&#8217;s a part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, Winston, my friend, thank you so much for this important work, uh, holding the banner up. I know this takes a lot of time. I know you&#8217;ve got a full-time gig. I know you&#8217;ve got a life</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> more,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> um, But I so much appreciate you post. I just appreciate you, our members do for doing this vitally important work and making a difference in our world that can, like we said, can be a reflection in all these thousands of communities we go out to, to say, how can I be more inclusive?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:00] How can I make sure everybody is represented as at least an opportunity to be represented? So I really appreciate you, <strong>Winstina</strong>, and your work and also just ringing the bell with me and teaching me and sharing, um, how we can make, make that difference. So I appreciate. Thanks for being. I&#8217;m thanks for being on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winstina Hughes:</strong> Sorry. No, no. I mean, I absolutely, like, this gives me life and it makes me wanna show up in the world, you know, different and energy. I wanna exercise more like , you know, like this is, this is, this is really in a lot of ways just like giving me energy to contribute. And so, um, to like, just to be able to like, work with you, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re, you know, I&#8217;m, I think you&#8217;re awesome</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know that, ditto.

So like, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s [00:46:00] see what we can do to continue to support our community so that the four freedoms, you know, I think that it&#8217;s, , it&#8217;s creating a fifth freedom, which is, you know, for all of us to be able to participate in a truly inclusive, um, community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, that speaks a lot to what the co-founders of WordPress. I think, um, you know, what, what they created and, and where they want, um, what their vision is and, you know, from their vision where we&#8217;re, um, going and or how we&#8217;re evolving as a community. I mean, to have 40% plus of a reach on the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s so many people around the world that are impacted by this project, you know? So, um, yeah, I love</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> that. Let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s add the fifth Freedom. I love that win. Coined by Win, and I love that leadership vision for our community. We need it. Thank you. Thank you, ma&#8217;am. You have a good rest of your year and we&#8217;ll see you in the next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For everybody listening, thanks for listening.

In this first episode of 2023, I wish all our listeners a wonderful, happy, prosperous and healthy new year. In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg releases 14.8, 14.9, WordPress 6.2 and beyond. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate, a full-time contributor to WordPress Open Source project. My guest today is Hector Prieto, full-time contributor on the WordPress Core team, coordinating multiple WordPress and Gutenberg releases. And it&#8217;s a great pleasure to finally have you on the show, Hector. Having a conversation about Gutenberg and WordPress with you is a wonderful way for me to start this new year. Happy New Year, feliz año nuevo, Hector. How are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Happy New Year. Hi, Birgit. I&#8217;m excited to join you on the podcast. It&#8217;s my pleasure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, the pleasure is really all mine. Where are you right now? Did you have a great holiday break?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: I&#8217;m currently in Alicante in Spain, very close to the Mediterranean Sea. And today we have a lovely sunny winter day with nearly 20 degrees Celsius. I had a few days to recharge and spend time with the family. What about you, did you enjoy your holidays?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, that&#8217;s some warm weather there in Alicante. I would love to have that. But here in Florida it&#8217;s balmy, too. It&#8217;s about 27 degrees, so we are in the air conditioning right now. Yes, my husband and I, we spent the week in Mexico City between Christmas and New Year&#8217;s. We saw some great art, powerful murals from the &#8217;50s and &#8217;70s and &#8217;60s. And we had fantastic food and a fabulous New Year&#8217;s event. It was great, at a restaurant over the roofs of Mexico City, so we really liked it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Wow, sounds really nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, Hector, as you are the first time on the show, maybe you can share briefly with our listeners your WordPress origin story. When did you come across WordPress the first time and what do you work on now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Well, my first time working with WordPress was around 2015 when I worked at the startup agency building sites. However, it wasn&#8217;t until 2020 that I first moved into the contributor space, and here we are. I am currently sponsored by Automattic to work full-time in Core in project management-related duties and supporting the development of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s wonderful. Well, thank you. So 2015, that&#8217;s just about two years before Gutenberg was introduced into the community. Did you, at your agency, have Gutenberg on the radar already, or did you heed the call to learn JavaScript deeply?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: It wasn&#8217;t until 2018 that we started using Gutenberg for the first time, when it was first released in 5.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Then the time between learning about WordPress and then starting contributing, that&#8217;s about five years. That&#8217;s pretty much the time that it took me to really embrace the contributing on WordPress, but I started at the Community Project in 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, so there are a few announcements that were happening since the last podcast episode. If you haven&#8217;t watched it yet, the recording of Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s State of the Word is available on WordPress TV. The transcript and answers to the questions that didn&#8217;t make it into the recording can be read on the follow-up post, State of the Word Reflections. Josepha Haden Chomphosy kicked off the State of the Word with a reminder on the four freedoms of WordPress, that you are free to run the program, you&#8217;re free to study and change the code, you&#8217;re free to distribute your code and also redistribute WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also recorded a separate WP briefing with her reflections in episode 45, State of the Word Reflections in which she highlights, among other things, learn WordPress, that 12,000 students actually went through the courses and the workshops already since the inception. And she also highlighted the WordPress Playground, which is a tool to run WordPress in the browser. You don&#8217;t need a server, you don&#8217;t need a database. You can run it in the browser and test plugins and themes. I think that changes how we approach some of the discovery for WordPress. We talked about it on the show here as well, but it&#8217;s definitely something that will have so many ramifications in the WordPress space later on when it&#8217;s still very raw and very not production ready. It&#8217;s just an idea that has already a proof of concept. And then the recap posts from the community are linked in the Gutenberg Weekend Edition 239 from December 17th, and you can check it out from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a side note that the Pew Research Center received a shoutout for the politology quiz that they built with blocks and had one million people already taking it. Seth Rubenstein is the lead developer and was a guest on a Gutenberg Times Live Q&amp;A last year. And he gave a great demonstration about their team&#8217;s work with the block editor, so as they went for the Gutenberg first approach building the website. The recording is available on the Gutenberg Times YouTube channel, and also we have a post here on the Gutenberg Times website as well. So as always, all these links are in the show notes of the 78th episode. So Hector, do you have any comments on this? What is your most exciting topic from the State of the Word? You had a few takeaways?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Yeah, there were a handful of them. I would actually highlight everything, starting with WordPress Playground. It&#8217;s such amazing technology and it&#8217;s going to open so many doors. But if I had to pick something, maybe for me because it is the thing I&#8217;m the closest to, it was a great recap about the progress WordPress made in the site editing front during the last year, to the point nowadays we can create themes directly in the editor just with blocks and patterns. This brings us very close to wrapping phase two and starting exploration around phase three in 2023. So it&#8217;s great to see that all these progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, you&#8217;re right, you&#8217;re right. And it&#8217;s been such a long journey as well. I look back at some of the history on the Gutenberg Times and the Gutenberg podcasts, and we first started talking about full-site editing in January of 2020. That was even pre-pandemic, and we had quite a few developers on our live Q&amp;A talking about the first concepts about that. So now, three years later, it&#8217;s almost finished and it&#8217;s really cool. There are still some things to be done, but I am really excited about the start of phase three of collaboration and I have been constantly trying to unify all the various tools and methods and interfaces to streamline my workflow to produce content for the web. And if I don&#8217;t have to use multiple tools to collaborate with people, I will have arrived on internet nirvana. Yeah, it&#8217;s a high calling of course, but yeah, we are all in a space where we could maybe make it happen. So I&#8217;m really excited about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Yeah. Also, it&#8217;s worth noting that even when we move to phase three and we can call a wrap on phase two, phase two will not be fully finished because there&#8217;s always going to be things to do related to site editing improvements, new tools. So I can see contributors working in new features for phase three and also iterating on phase two items. Another big takeaway for me during State of the Word was seeing how much Gutenberg itself has matured. And it&#8217;s now been used in more projects such as Tumblr, bbPress, and even in some mobile apps like Day One. Also, let&#8217;s not forget how WordCamps have made a comeback after COVID hit and stopped all the in-person events. And we went from one single WordCamp in 2021 to up to 22 in the last year, in 2022. That&#8217;s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s a nice iteration of the numbers. 22 WordCamps in &#8217;22.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Exactly. Especially since the community is what makes WordPress what it is, it&#8217;s the most important part of WordPress. So that&#8217;s really good to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely. Having the first WordPress in-person event in WordCamp Europe, I realized how much I missed interacting with everybody else in the community and seeing new faces and interacting with old friends. I looked up the number of WordCamps that were done in 2019, in-person WordCamps, and there were 148, or 145, something like that. So there is quite a bit of time to go between 22 to 142 or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s coming back especially because all those WordPress meetups, the local meetups, are all coming back as well. I think there was a note in the State of the Word that out of the 500, 260 have already come back to in-person events. And we know that WordPress meetups are actually the prerequisite to actually have local WordCamp organizers together to organize a WordCamp. So yeah, it&#8217;s all coming back and I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s coming back because of the connection that you have in the community. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: As I mentioned earlier, I came to the contributing space in 2020. It was during the pandemic, so actually my first WordCamp was the only WordCamp in 2021. And my second WordCamp was for computer ware in last year. So it was really nice and refreshing for me to meet all the other contributors. It is something special, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely, yeah. It was great to meet you, Hector, although we had so many meetings with people on Zoom. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Fun times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Well, circling back to State of the Word, I would also like to point out that, last but not least, it&#8217;s really cool to see how Openverse has grown since joined WordPress about a year and a half ago. And I&#8217;m super excited to see that coming, Openverse integration in WordPress that will allow users to directly search and add images from Openverse into their WordPress site without leaving the editor at all. That&#8217;s super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s super cool. And I think it would also be really cool to have that also go back to if somebody uploads an image to WordPress and checks the check mark, also put it into Openverse. I think that part would really make it to a 360 kind of integration. I also love that there&#8217;s not only for images, but there is a lot of audio already uploaded to the Openverse that you can use on podcasts or on videos, and add free without having to think about royalties and buying for it and all that. Yeah, so free to the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: There&#8217;s so many possibilities there. The future is exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s really exciting. And I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s all happening in conjunction with WordPress. The same with the WordPress photos library, where people can just upload their photos and have it be it in the public domain and make it available to the broader community. It&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>WordPress 6.2</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. So between Christmas and New Year&#8217;s, Hector, you published the release schedule proposal for 6.2. I think it was something we were all waiting for. Kind of, okay, how do we plan first quarter when we don&#8217;t know when the release is coming? So you provided. So if the release team concurs, what&#8217;s the plan? When will we see the first Beta?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: If the proposed plan is approved, the first Beta release will be on February 7th, which is 10 days before the first of our WordCamp Asia takes place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. In the planning schedule, you also have a call for contributors to volunteer for the release squad. So if you, dear listeners, are inclined to take part in it and you already have a little experience in contributing, throw your hat in the ring by commenting on the release post on the scheduled proposal post. And also throw your hat in the ring also means for those who English is their second language, also means raise your hand, you want to volunteer to be part of it, and then the release team is coming together. When do you expect that you will have a final plan?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: The call for volunteers is open as we speak. Considering the end of the year vacation people are taking, contributors taking, I think we won&#8217;t have anything until end of next week or the following one. We&#8217;re leaving some extra time for people to come back from the holidays and chime in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Okay. Yeah, so there are only two more Gutenberg releases before the feature freeze, if I calculate that correctly. We better get started in reviewing all the great new features that are coming in, in a more consolidated way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Definitely. I encourage all of our listeners to start testing and giving feedback. It&#8217;s always super helpful. Also, compared to the past releases, the proposed 6.2 schedule both include a fourth Beta release compared to the previous three ones to leave some extra buffer time between WordCamp Asia and release candidate one, which will be on March 7th for a final release on March 28th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, okay. Yeah, so contributor day at WordCamp Asia is definitely going to be part of it and that is really cool to have. Maybe we need to organize some tables that do some testing there. I don&#8217;t know how far the work of Asia contributor day team is about that, but having that plan definitely gives us all focus on that contributor day. All right, cool. So to repeat that, final release could be March 28th, so that&#8217;s about three months from today. And we will have a 6.2 release, provided everything works out as we anticipate now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have a reminder for our listeners now for next week. The Gutenberg Times Live Q&amp;A, Layout, Layout Layout will be happening on January 11th at 5:00 PM Eastern. That&#8217;s 22:00 UTC. And in this show, Isabel Brison, Andrew Serong, Justin Tadlock and I will discuss the opportunities and challenges for all the layout features for site builders. And we will be available for questions and answer them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Isabel Brison will also give us a demo of the various layout scenarios to use. She has, with Andrew, been instrumental in building all the features into the site editor and the blocks, and it&#8217;s going to be a very interesting show. It&#8217;s also going to be a little preview on Isabel Brison&#8217;s talk at WordCamp Asia in February 2023. So join us, link us in the show notes, and don&#8217;t forget you need to register there and to be&#8230; We will have a recording, of course, with the show notes and as well as a transcript, but it&#8217;s always good to have your questions answered live by the experts on the panel, and we have some great experts there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that brings us to the latest Gutenberg releases. First, there&#8217;s Gutenberg 14.8. That was released in December 12th. Ryan Welcher was release lead and it had 167 PRs merged by 42 contributors, five of which were first contributors. So welcome to the project, first contributors. So Hector, what&#8217;s the most significant enhancement in this release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Well, Gutenberg 14.8, so several changes to the site editor user interface, and introduce something I&#8217;m super excited about, which is browse mode. Thanks to this first iteration of browse mode, users can switch between editing and browsing modes in the site editor, making it much easier to navigate through templates and template parts or even add new ones through the sidebar. It&#8217;s a feature that has been long awaited and it&#8217;s finally here and I&#8217;m super excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And it helps you with where you land when you click on the site editor. You are now not landing into editing your homepage and so now you have a better entrance into the site editor. And I really like that because it gets you better settled into what you&#8217;re going to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: It makes for a nicer onboarding and it&#8217;s less dangerous, let&#8217;s say, because it&#8217;s much more difficult to break your design just as soon as you land on the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, totally. So the navigation block also had some enhancements, especially with the migration from the old menu. So if you have a location primary, it will now fall back to the navigation menu from the classic menu. That is really helpful on the transition. There are other fallback updates made that it also uses the most recently created menu from the classic theme when you start migrating to a block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is definitely a good help for transitioning from a classic theme to a block theme. But also it kind of decreases the mental load that you don&#8217;t have to recreate all your menus when you switch out the theme, which is something that was sometimes really critical in the classic menu, in the classic theme space, where everybody had different menu locations. And so I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s completely solved yet, but this is definitely a first step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Yes, it&#8217;s a step on the right direction. We all know building menus is one of the most challenging aspects of building your site. And contributors are making a huge step for making the menu building process much easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. There&#8217;s also one that came with 14.8 that is for the query block. The parent block is they removed the color block support just because it was always clashing up against the other blocks that are in the query block for the post template for the title and the excerpt. You could kind of get lost in which color did we do, and where do we do that? So removing it from the wrapper query block is definitely a good choice because it removes some of that confusion of where colors are actually set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Exactly. Contributors have seen a few inconsistencies when adding the color to the wrapper query block, between the title, between the navigation links. So now the colors block supports are all in the inner blocks and there&#8217;s no space for confusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So what else do we see there? Yeah, I think that was it on the 14.8 release, on the highlights. There are certainly the sidebar tabs for the navigation blocks. There is great work on the experimentation that happened. So right now we have five areas of experimentation in the Gutenberg plugin and there is only two more freeze, two more releases to get them out of experimentation into the production of the Gutenberg plugin. One of them is the sidebar for the navigation block. The other one is the separated settings tab in the sidebar that separates the styles from the features. And then the others, I don&#8217;t recall right now. Hang on, I&#8217;m going to check them out. I just had it there and then I closed my browser because, I don&#8217;t know, sometimes I just randomly close browser tabs, which is a really good way to confuse myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: The type interface is making good progress and it&#8217;s something we would likely see out of experimental very soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, yeah. And then is the global styles for custom CSS is actually in&#8230; We all wait for that, but it&#8217;s now in the experimental stage and need to be switched on through experiments menu item on the Gutenberg plugin. And then the other one is the color randomizer utility that lets you mix the current color palette randomly and change it out. That&#8217;s kind of a funky way of handling your website to do a randomized color palette, but it certainly is a proof of concept of something bigger. Was there anything else in the 14.8 you want to mention, Hector?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Well, there are a few other main highlights that you might have seen, our listeners might have seen in the release post. One of them is super interesting, which is the custom CSS rules for your site. There&#8217;s now a tiny CSS text field where you can add your custom CSS directly in the editor. As we all know, with great power comes responsibility. So it&#8217;s nice that you can add a custom CSS directly in the editor, but let&#8217;s not overuse the important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s definitely a way to&#8230; But that was before, so site editors or site users or site owners who used the custom CSS piece found that that was the missing piece to actually sign on to the full site editing, because they couldn&#8217;t do those very fast changes like changing a font size somewhere or changing a space somewhere or change the color of a border very easily by just using the developer tools, identifying the marker, the selector, and then just change the color in a custom CSS. Yeah, it opens up the capabilities for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need definitely have file editing capabilities on the server and that sometimes was not available to anybody. But those who used it, they really missed it in the file site editing, in the site editing features, so that is really a good thing. And there is also a&#8230; It&#8217;s not yet released and it&#8217;s not merged yet in, but I know that Carolina Nymark is actually working on custom CSS for single blocks. And I think that&#8217;s also a good way to, in the paradigm of getting atomic design going, that that&#8217;s probably a better approach than having custom CSS being pulled in for every site page or page with the custom CSS. Rather do it per block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, it&#8217;s kind of a interesting feature that people want to have some control or at least go back to that what they are used to do and figure out how they can change it. Well, that definitely was a changelog of 14.8. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve forgotten anything. I think we, in the release post by Ryan, it was a reorganized&#8230;. Oh, the style book is definitely something that was in 4.8. We haven&#8217;t talked about it. So do you want to talk about it, what that does?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Oh yeah, definitely. The style book is a super cool new feature, which is extension of the style site editor. The style book in a nutshell gives you an overview of all the available blocks you have in a single place so that you can easily browse all the blocks you have available and play with their design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: When Gutenberg first came out, there were quite a few initiatives where you could have a unit test for blocks, where I think Rich Tabor actually had a plugin and I also worked with some of our clients back then when that we had a list of all the blocks in a page and then looked at it, how the theme works with it. And that was kind of a block unit testing in design. And with the additional features that come with site editing, it was a hard time to figure out what is a change in color on the paragraph block will have additional ramification throughout the site, or when you change style variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m really glad that the style book, that&#8217;s a menu item in the site editor. You can go there and then see all the blocks that you have. And you get an access to the style variations of your theme so you can select them and then see how the blocks change. And that is so powerful that you don&#8217;t have this save and surprise effect anymore. You really look at it and say, &#8220;Oh yeah, I like it.&#8221; And you also see where the style variations may not be entirely working for your site because there are some things that are left out. So this is so powerful for the experience with the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: For our listeners to picture it in their mind, it&#8217;s like having a page with demo content with all the blocks. You have it registered either core blocks or third party blocks. So as soon as you install it, applying that provides blocks, all these third party blocks will appear in the style book. And you will be able to see all of them together, play with the global styles, play with the accelerations, and see how they affect all these first party and third party blocks in a single place as if you have demo content page but automatically generated for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So it really offsets the need for these block unit testings and it&#8217;s very, very powerful. Yeah, I so agree. I think we&#8217;ve got it all now. Let&#8217;s move on to the next release, which was 14.9. And it has at the time of this recording not been released, but it will come out any hour now. For those who use the Gutenberg plugin on their sites, it&#8217;s the first Gutenberg release for 2023. 132 PRs by 46 contributors. Again, five new contributors in there. Congrats for your merge of your PR, and welcome to the project. Thank you so much for your contributions, for all of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: It&#8217;s refreshing to see all these new contributors, even in these more maintenance oriented releases that happen during holidays. So congratulations to you all, and welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: What are the highlights? What did you see, or what&#8217;s in the release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: There are a few changes. They&#8217;re mostly iterative, building on top of past features and enhancements. One of them, one very cool, is a new push to global styles button that appears in the cyber blocks, which allows users to, once they edit the blocks&#8217; style and they like it and they say, &#8220;Hey, I like this how this is looking or how this image is looking. I would like all my image blocks to look like this.&#8221; It allows them to push those styles to global styles so that they automatically affect all the blocks of that type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. And that&#8217;s also why it&#8217;s good to have this style book handy so you can actually see if you made a mistake or something like that and said, &#8220;Oh no, I didn&#8217;t consider this, so let&#8217;s do one more time.&#8221; Yeah. So that&#8217;s a great feature. Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Also, for those who like building patterns, now when registering patterns, there&#8217;s a new property that allows you to specify in which template a pattern makes sense. Let&#8217;s suppose, for example, we are building a 404 pattern. Previously it would be released everywhere, so it would appear everywhere in all kinds of templates. Now you can limit it to only appear on a 404 template, so it doesn&#8217;t bring noise to other templates where it doesn&#8217;t make sense. So this is going to improve pattern discoverability in general as patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it also improves separation of concerns. As you said, it will not show up on every page where even if it&#8217;s not suitable for the pattern. But it also themes can then, or plugin can now create custom post types and that all, and just make those patterns available for certain custom post types. I think that is definitely a missing piece that has now been added to it. Excellent. Yeah, I&#8217;m really excited about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Yes, there&#8217;s a minor update following up on Gutenberg 14.5. So we are thinking, we&#8217;re looking at two months ago, three months ago, when the list view and the document outline were merged in a single panel. We have seen there are a few improvements that can be made in the design. So now, for example, the word count has been moved to the top of the outline for more clarity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, there was some confusion. Where is it now? Yeah. And then you didn&#8217;t see it at first because when you hit on update, you post and then the little notification ball totally covered that piece. So it took a while till that goes away so you see the word count and the time to read and also the block count. There were a few pieces missing. I don&#8217;t know why they&#8217;re missing, but they probably don&#8217;t seem to be very important for content creators to see. And the outline, having the other one on the list here in one it definitely makes sense to have that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you haven&#8217;t seen that yet, it was in Gutenberg 14.5. It will come to 6.2, so checking it out through the Gutenberg plugin is definitely worth trying, worth a look so your site owners or the clients are prepared to find it in a different space. What I&#8217;m also very excited about is that there is now an option to import widgets from the sidebars into template parts. And that is in the whole idea of transitioning from a classic theme to block themes or make a site be better prepared to move to a site, to full site editing block theme. This is definitely a step forward. Any additional thoughts on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Oh yeah, absolutely. This is a very important milestone towards block adoption because it allows users to migrate from classic widgets to native blocks. It&#8217;s worth noting that it doesn&#8217;t work on template focus mode yet, it&#8217;s only available for the block inspector. But this is definitely a step on the right direction to increase block adoption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent, yeah. And George Mamadashvili, who heads&#8230; That&#8217;s his PR. He also has a nice video on how he demonstrates how it&#8217;s going to work. So I hear quite a few people celebrating this piece to make the transition over. Another one is, this is minor thing, but the configurable settings for the fluid typography in the theme JSONs now has a minimum font size, so it can be anchored on the smallest font size. So the fluidity then can increase the font size on a bigger screen. There was a hard coded value of 14 pixels before, with no way to change. And now you can have the minimum font size, like 16 pixels or 18 pixels depending on your site needs. That&#8217;s a minor thing, but I think it is something that quite a few designers were missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Yes, absolutely. It&#8217;s a minor improvement, but we&#8217;ve seen lots of these minor improvements in the last, I don&#8217;t know, four or five Gutenberg releases building on top of free typography. And when you look at them altogether combined, you can see huge improvements on how the feature is becoming more and more powerful by the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. I think that was at 14 point&#8230; No, one thing is still really important from the release and that is the adding shadow presets support for the theme JSON. So you can do box shadows on your blocks or wrapper blocks, and that is now available for designers of themes. There is no user interface for that yet. But as we said repeatedly here on the podcast, things will be…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: It will come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Hmm?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: It will come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But it&#8217;s important to make it work for the theme developers first. Before you have all the added implementation for site owners that want to change it, you first need to know how it&#8217;s actually working so you can see where the pieces are that need to be surfaced in a user interface. So there is a new setting object called shadow, and then you can add different palettes to it for natural and crisp and sharp and soft shadows. And the PR has quite a few information about how that&#8217;s implemented. It gives you quite a few use cases on how you can do the shadow boxes for the buttons, for cover block, for menu block. If you have a sticky menu, then you can put a little shadow underneath it to see the difference between the page and the menu. So there are quite a few design use cases to try that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: I&#8217;m curious to see what designers come up with thanks to this new setting. I can see lots of 3D buttons and shadow buttons and all these cool things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You could even do the outlines of the shadows, kind of, if you have an outline&#8230; Yeah, there are some great designs out there right now. So, from the changelog we are on, anything else that you wanted to talk about here that we missed? I know that Tonya Mark has updated the tracking issue for the web fonts API. And what&#8217;s merged in this release is the change of architecture to use the Core&#8217;s dependencies API with the web fonts API. And there&#8217;s a call for testing out there, or it will be out there, and making sure that how you use it. She has an update where she asked how you can help. And that is if you have an idea about naming the API, should it be webfonts, or web fonts, two words, or just the fonts API, which I tend to be the fonts API, but there is a renaming before everything gets into the Core that we&#8217;ll be name things right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other one is a call to test the new architecture and share feedback on your testing reports and using the web fonts API. I&#8217;m not quite sure how the planning is because it seems to be still blocked furthermore through additional architectural work. Hector, do you think that that will come with 6.2, or is it now a little late for 6.2?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Well, Tony and the other contributors are making their best to have this feature land in 6.2, so I&#8217;m pretty positive it can make it in 6.2. And the best way to ensure it can land in that version is to help with testing and with feedback. That will help unlock the architecture redesign and the renaming and everything that&#8217;s currently being discussed right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Okay. Yeah, if you all are contributing to things, dear listeners, help getting that over the finish line. It definitely needs some testing. So I think that&#8217;s the end of talking about Gutenberg 14.9. We&#8217;re coming also up on the hour, so I think we can go to closing things. Are there anything that you want to point out that are on the roadmap for 6.2 that you want to have our listeners know? And if not, how can the listeners get in contact with you, where to best meet you online?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Well, you can reach out to me in WordPress Slack. Handle is Prieto. I guess it will be written in the show notes. So please feel free to ping me there or in GitHub or in Track. I&#8217;m using the handle everywhere, so that&#8217;s easy. I would just like to circle back to the 6.2 planning and reminding everyone the call for volunteers is open. So if you&#8217;re interested in participating in the squad, you are more than welcome. We will assist you if it&#8217;s your first time. If you&#8217;re an assistant contributor, you are also welcome and we can learn from you. So everybody&#8217;s welcome, that&#8217;s the long story short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And the only thing that I want to remind you is about the next week&#8217;s Gutenberg Live Q&amp;A with Isabel Brison, Andrew Serong and Justin Tadlock on Layout, Layout, Layout. January 11th at 5:00 PM Eastern and 20:22 UTC. That&#8217;s 10:00 PM on UTC. And as always, the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is episode 78.

It&#8217;s particular helpful when your blog is about working with the block editor or about content creation with WordPress. Landsiedel feels that the block editor makes the shortcomings of the built-in search feature worse because blocks contain full words, and not just HTML tags.

These include many more development topics, such as security, CI/CD, headless CMS, ReactJS for PHP Developers / Building Blocks, and more. Attendees are also eager to hear about content monetization, recurring revenue, GDPR compliance, brand identity, and designing for accessibility, to list a few examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Presentation formats will include traditional talks, hands-on workshops, expert panels, and lightning talks. Organizers are encouraging speakers to add activities to sessions that will get the audience involved and avoid the afternoon slump. They cited a few examples, including a WordCamp in the Czech Republic where a security researcher installed a Wi-Fi honeypot in the venue and demonstrated how dangerous public wi-fi is when logging into a WordPress site that doesn&#8217;t have SSL. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WCEU has launched a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/?page_id=2755\" target=\"_blank\">Speaker’s support program</a> to help fund selected speakers with financial barriers to attending. Organizers arrange for speakers and the sponsoring companies to connect but are not involved in selecting who receives the funds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The call for speakers will close the first week of February and applicants will receive a response by the second week of March. Speakers will be announced in the second week of April.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 07 Jan 2023 03:18:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:125:\"WPTavern: BuddyPress 11.0.0 Adds Filter for Improved JS and CSS Asset Loading, WebP Support, and New Ways to Fetch Activities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=140854\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:134:\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-11-0-0-adds-filter-for-improved-js-and-css-asset-loading-webp-support-and-new-ways-to-fetch-activities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3436:\"<p><a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2023/01/buddypress-11-0-0-la-scala/\">BuddyPress 11.0.0</a> is now available thanks to the efforts of 34 contributors. The release is named “La Scala” in honor of a pizza restaurant located in Issy-Les-Moulineaux, a Paris suburb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 11.0.0 introduces a few important changes. BuddyPress has <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-11-0-0-to-limit-javascript-and-css-asset-loading-to-community-pages-using-a-filter\">improved the way it loads its JavaScript and CSS assets</a> with the addition of <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2022/11/21/buddypress-will-soon-only-load-its-javascript-and-style-assets-into-the-community-area-of-your-site/\">a new filter</a> so that they are now only loaded on community pages. Previously, the plugin would load them indiscriminately on every page, a leftover from how they were loaded in the first Template Pack (BP Legacy). This change is being rolled out progressively, so users who want to take advantage of this improvement will need to add the filter to their <a href=\"https://codex.buddypress.org/themes/bp-custom-php/\">bp-custom.php</a> file.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>add_filter( ‘bp_enqueue_assets_in_bp_pages_only’, ‘__return_true’ );</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>BP 11.0.0 also enables the use of use <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2022/11/24/webp-support-is-arriving-in-buddypress-11-0-0/\">.webp</a> images for profile and cover images, after a user requested it in a negative review. This feature requires WordPress 5.8 or newer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release introduces the ability to <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2022/12/01/bp-11-fetch-activities-for-or-excluding-a-group-of-users/\">fetch activities for or excluding a group of users</a>. For example, developers can now write code to fetch activities for a select few users based on user ID or block updates from some annoying users by excluding their user IDs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This change is simple but powerful!&#8221; BuddyPress core developer Dan Cavins said. &#8220;For instance, you could create custom interest activity streams, or build a mute feature to let your members take a break from other, too-chatty users!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 11.0.0 also gives developers the ability to build custom xProfile loops <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2022/12/06/bp-11-bp_has_profile-now-accepts-an-array-of-profile-group-ids/\">including a specific set of profile field groups</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BuddyPress 10.0.0 introduced an add-ons section in the plugin administration screen for users to easily test plugins or blocks maintained by the BuddyPress development team and hosted on WordPress.org. BP lead developer Mathieu Viet said the team will soon be publishing a Community Media Attachments add-on and a block-based Activity Post Form that will &#8220;standardize the way to extend activity updates with richer and more engaging content.&#8221; These feature plugins are part of what Viet anticipates will be &#8220;a transitional year for BuddyPress&#8221; and may be published to the add-ons section independent of a major release. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>BuddyPress users should watch for updates to the add-ons section and check out the full list of changes in <a href=\"https://codex.buddypress.org/releases/version-11-0-0/\">11.0.0 in the BuddyPress codex</a>.

For example, if a user makes a change to a Heading block on the Page template, that doesn&#8217;t get automatically enabled for headings on other templates, which could potentially create an inconsistent design across the website. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new &#8220;Push changes to Global Styles&#8221; button allows users to apply that same change to all blocks of that type. In the example below, the H1 heading has been updated to have a lime green background with red text. Under the Advanced panel in block settings, a new button appears for pushing changes to Global Styles.  </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the feature only works inside the Site Editor. Users writing posts and pages will not have the ability to push changes to Global Styles. The new button gives users a quick way to update blocks across the site without having to manually edit every template or figure out the right CSS to apply. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other important changes in 14.9 include <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/43316\">typography support for the Page List block</a>, a new option to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/45509\">import sidebar widgets into a template part</a> when switching from a classic theme, and  word count/time to read meta info has been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/46648\">moved to the top of the outline</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New Features for Theme Authors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 14.9 introduces support for shadow presets in theme.json, with two bundled default presets (Natural and Sharp). Theme authors can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/46813\">see how it&#8217;s done</a> and create&nbsp;custom box-shadow presets, or wait for an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/issues/51\">upcoming tutorial</a> on the topic. The 14.9 release post includes a screenshot of how this feature might be implemented:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors now have the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42489\">set the minimum font size for fluid typography in theme.json</a>. It is currently hard coded to 14px by default, which may not work for all designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another new tool for theme developers is the ability to register patterns for specific templates, which would restrict where they appear. This was added via <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/45814\">a new templateType property</a> in the patterns registration API. Theme developers can restrict patterns to only show up for the templates where they make sense, such as 404, single-post, single-product, and category templates, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/01/04/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-9-4-january/\">14.9 release post</a> to see all the bug fixes and enhancements to the editor, accessibility, performance, tooling, and more. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 05 Jan 2023 22:20:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"Do The Woo Community: A 2023 Update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=74218\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://dothewoo.io/2023-update/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:357:\"<p>In 2022, the show released 115 episodes featuring 112 guests, discussing a wide range of topics related to WooCommerce and e-commerce. </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/2023-update/\">A 2023 Update</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 05 Jan 2023 10:10:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: New CF7 Blocks Plugin Brings Blocks to Contact Form 7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=140765\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wptavern.com/new-cf7-blocks-plugin-brings-blocks-to-contact-form-7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3006:\"<p>WordPress developer Munir Kamal has released a new plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cf7-blocks/\">CF7 Blocks</a> that does exactly what it says in the name. It brings blocks to one of WordPress&#8217; most beloved plugins, which has kept the same familiar interface and has not yet adopted the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/\">Contact Form 7</a> plugin was created by WordPress developer <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/takayukister/\">Takayuki Miyoshi</a>, who has devotedly kept it updated for the past 15 years. His stalwart commitment to <a href=\"https://ideasilo.wordpress.com/2012/04/28/free-plugin-declaration/\">keeping it free forever</a> is one of the reasons it has grown to more than 5 million active installs. The developer community has built hundreds of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/cf7/\">integrations and extensions for CF7</a> because users found it easy to build forms with its simple interface. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />Contact Form 7 interface\n\n\n\n<p>CF7 users currently edit forms in the plugin&#8217;s dedicated interface. The plugin also includes a block, so users can return to the block editor and select a form to embed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new CF7 Blocks plugin makes it possible to edit CF7 forms using WordPress&#8217; default editor, instead of having to mess with shortcodes and HTML. It still has its own dedicated Contact form editing page, except with the ability to customize fields as blocks. New forms will use the block interface and old ones can still be edited using CF7&#8217;s default HTML editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CF7 Blocks offers a more intuitive experience with pre-made form templates that will automatically insert the necessary blocks so users don&#8217;t have to start from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>In the block settings, users can easily customize the text of the labels, enter a value for placeholders, toggle the label on or off, mark fields as required, customize dimensions, and more. Fields can easily be dragged and dropped for re-ordering, a feature that is especially useful with lengthier, more complex forms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One handy feature is that form fields can easily be transformed into other fields with the click of a button, making it easy to customize a form when the pre-set templates aren&#8217;t exactly what is needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>In the same tradition of Contact Form 7, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cf7-blocks/\">CF7 Blocks</a> is available for free in the WordPress plugin directory. The plugin also has its own <a href=\"https://cf7blocks.com/\">website</a> where users can <a href=\"https://cf7blocks.substack.com/\">subscribe</a> to get updates and find out what&#8217;s coming soon.

It exploits 30 theme and plugin vulnerabilities to inject malicious JavaScript into websites, redirecting visitors to the attacker&#8217;s selected website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report states that Doctor Webs&#8217; analysis of the application revealed that <strong>&#8220;it could be the malicious tool that cybercriminals have been using for more than three years to carry out such attacks and monetize the resale of traffic, or arbitrage.&#8221;</strong> During this time, the tool has been updated to target more exploitable vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two versions of the malware &#8211; <a href=\"https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.BackDoor.WordPressExploit.1&lng=en\">Linux.BackDoor.WordPressExploit.1</a> and <a href=\"https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.BackDoor.WordPressExploit.2&lng=en\">Linux.BackDoor.WordPressExploit.2</a>. Version 1 seeks to exploit vulnerabilities in popular plugins like WP GDPR Compliance,  Easysmtp, WP Live Chat, and a dozen other free and commercial extensions. A few of these have been known to have frequent vulnerabilities and one was <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/yuzo-related-post/\">closed due to guideline violations</a> but may still be active on some sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An updated Version 2 has a different server address for distributing the malicious JavaScript and an additional list of exploited vulnerabilities for a few more widely used plugins, including FV Flowplayer Video Player, Brizy Page Builder, WooCommerce, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctor Web&#8217;s report also speculates that attackers may have engineered a long game plan that will give them administrative access even after users update to newer (patched) versions of the compromised plugins: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Both trojan variants have been found to contain unimplemented functionality for hacking the administrator accounts of targeted websites through a brute-force attack—by applying known logins and passwords, using special vocabularies. It is possible that this functionality was present in earlier modifications, or, conversely, that attackers plan to use it for future versions of this malware. If such an option is implemented in newer versions of the backdoor, cybercriminals will even be able to successfully attack some of those websites that use current plugin versions with patched vulnerabilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctor Web published a document with <a href=\"https://github.com/DoctorWebLtd/malware-iocs/tree/master/Linux.Backdoor.WordPressExploit.1\">indicators of compromise</a>, detailing hashes, IPs, and domains that the Linux backdoor malware has been using to infect WordPress websites. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Jan 2023 22:14:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"Post Status: On The Fediverse, WordPress, And Activity Pub With Matthias Pfefferle — Post Status Draft 135\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=146145\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"https://poststatus.com/on-the-fediverse-wordpress-and-activity-pub-with-matthias-pfefferle-post-status-draft-135/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7125:\"<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group eplus-wrapper has-theme-palette-2-color has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\"><a href=\"https://notiz.blog/\">Matthias Pfefferle</a> is head of WordPress development at a hosting company in Europe and the creator of <a href=\"https://activitypub.rocks/\">Activity Pub</a>, a WordPress plugin.

Current social networks have stripped creators of agency and power. The threat has been more acutely felt with the recent transitions within Twitter. Recognizing what is at stake and moving towards innovation could not only create needed solutions but could also propel the future of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> So much of the power of WordPress is rooted in decentralization. The silos created by social media platforms leave users without agency. The potential and appetite for decentralization is increasing along with the tools to make it a reality via the Fediverse, Activity Pub, and more.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Portable Social Networks:</strong> If you are blocked or banned from a major social network, you lose your content and contacts. The need to create portable social networks so you can move your audience and retain your content if you opt to or are forced to switch platforms or hosts is crucial.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Alternative Walled Gardens:</strong> The need for alternative social platforms where users have agency and ownership continues to increase. The Twitter debacle has been a huge catalyst for users to transition to other platforms like Mastodon, but the potential for WordPress to solve identifier issues and more could create the largest platform overnight. How can we create tools and empower people to be a part of social networks and retain ownership of all they create? How can WordPress build on the current momentum to create future relevance?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-container-24 wp-block-columns has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"WP-Engine\">\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-column\">\n<h3><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/a2-hosting\">A2 Hosting</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A2Hosting offers solutions for WordPress and WooCommerce that are both blazing fast and ultra-reliable.</strong> WordPress can be easily deployed on <em>ANY</em> web hosting plan from A2: Shared, VPS, or Dedicated.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, the future of styling your WordPress website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m very keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you or your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Damon Cook. He&#8217;s a long time user of WordPress, trying it first in around 2008. He&#8217;s worked for some of the largest WordPress agencies over the years, but his current role is that of Developer Advocate with WP Engine, where he engages with the WordPress community, trying to figure out where WordPress is headed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Damon is on the podcast today to talk about styling WordPress, and how it&#8217;s changing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up until recently, if you wanted to modify your website&#8217;s appearance, you needed to work with the theme. Sometimes this could be done in the theme&#8217;s UI or in the WordPress customizer. But if you really needed fine control, then it&#8217;s likely you edited the themes files or created a theme of your own. It can be quite a complex process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block-based themes or revolutionizing websites styling. You&#8217;re going to be able to modify any aspect of your website from the UI that you&#8217;re familiar with. The hope is that it&#8217;ll make styling more accessible to a wider audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Damon talks about the fact that we&#8217;re in a period of flux right now. The documentation and tooling needed to work with website styles is maturing, but is by no means complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk through some of the new concepts which are underpinning all of this. Style variations, style engine, global styles, block themes, block patterns, theme.json. These are perhaps terms that you&#8217;ve heard being used, but might not be familiar with. Damon explains what they are and where they fit into the website styling jigsaw.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, we briefly get into the work that Damon has been doing with ACF to make his own blocks, and how it provides a bridge for those people who are not yet familiar with React.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading over to. WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. And you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Damon Cook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Damon Cook. Hello Damon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:42] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Hi Nathan. How you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Very nice. Thank you for joining us on the podcast today. Damon is going to have a chat with us today all about, well, a whole myriad of things, to be honest. But largely it&#8217;s about the things which are either currently in WordPress, potentially recently put into WordPress, or maybe even some things which are coming down the path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He works for WP Engine. His role there is a really interesting one actually. It&#8217;s called Developer Advocate. I&#8217;m going to dig into what that role entails in a minute, in more depth. But Damon, will you just give us a little bit of a background of your journey with WordPress Just to orientate the listeners, what have you been up to in the WordPress space? When did you come across WordPress? Go as far back as you like to make it work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:26] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Sure. I was thinking about that this morning. I&#8217;m trying to remember what my origin date would be. If I had to guess, because I&#8217;m not clear on it, but I probably started working with WordPress back in around 2008. I remember multi-site was just getting an introduction. Well, it was MU, multi-user, at the time. So, that was where I was introduced. I actually created an internal blogging platform for a state university I was working at at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was neat to start working with open source tools. And I left there and went into agency land for about a decade where I worked with solely WordPress focused agencies like TenUp, WebDevStudios, and a few others. And, that is where I really focused my work as a front end developer. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve come to WP Engine with, I&#8217;ve been here about four or five months and, I&#8217;ve always found it a passion of mine to give back in to the community and really advocate and try to raise awareness around some of the newer features coming out of WordPress, which is, these days seems to be going at a pretty breakneck speed with Gutenberg. So, there&#8217;s a lot going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, there really is a lot going on and we we&#8217;ll dig more into that and your interest in it in a moment. But I want to just dwell on your job title if you don&#8217;t mind, a developer advocate at WP Engine. I have heard this muttered a few times by various different people from WP Engine, amongst other companies, and never really that sure what that role entails. So would you mind just spelling it out? I know that you&#8217;re new to the role, so maybe still finding your feet, I don&#8217;t know, but just tell us what the purpose of that job title is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:20] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Yeah, I am new to it and it is interesting and, I see it as trying to gauge and engage with the community around WordPress. And that is as broad as it can be as in community, because coming from a agency world I tend to definitely focus and have a bias towards developer solutions. But at the end of the day, I&#8217;ve always been passionate about creating experiences for the end user, for builders of any stages of learning whether it&#8217;s a marketer building a site, or you know, somebody who has a background as a developer or an enterprise developer, or a designer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So trying to engage with that community and see where there are any gaps or barriers to onboarding them, really to any of the latest things coming out of the project, or elevate their experience in creating and building sites with WordPress, I guess. And with that also, giving back to WordPress core make teams. I&#8217;ve been trying to contribute a little bit to the Docs team and the Learn team. And that&#8217;s all sponsored by WP Engine too, as a developer advocate role. So that&#8217;s kind of the lay of the land as I see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s absolutely fascinating. Can I ask, can I drill deeper into this, because find it really interesting. Where do you go looking for the WordPress community? Because it&#8217;s pretty clear that, well, it&#8217;s as broad as it is deep. You could find WordPress people in almost every walk of life. Every age group, every part of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, you can&#8217;t spread yourself throughout the world, so you probably have to do a lot of this online. And, well, there&#8217;s Slack, there&#8217;s Make, there&#8217;s, well there&#8217;s podcasts like this, there&#8217;s news outlets, There&#8217;s all sorts of different places where these people find themselves. And I guess you&#8217;ve got to try and touch as many of those as possible to gauge all of the different opinions. Where do you find yourself, well spending most of your time? Where do you seem to put your endeavors?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:29] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s the answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:33] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Yeah. That seems to be, it seems to be the most engaging and successful platform for that type of community. Which, with the current state of affairs there is concerning because I feel like there has been such a great buildup and yeah, it&#8217;s a great platform to engage with the community and reach a large audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I&#8217;ll be curious to see. I know lots of people are migrating to other platforms and there&#8217;s conversations of different experiments and explorations, which I think are great because, really I&#8217;m all for owning your content and however we can expedite that process for anybody is a cool thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, Twitter is the heart of a lot of it. But Slack, WordPress communities, Make communities even. Again, probably my bias is being in Gutenberg pull requests and issues, and trying to give feedback and even sharing some of the higher level issues to see if the community is interested in pursuing or giving feedback on those features, or if they&#8217;re just something that&#8217;s not even warranted to pursue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there tends to be definitely bias of what, you know, a lot of these areas that we&#8217;re focusing on for new features can at times. Yeah. I think the more input we can and the more eyes then the better validation and verification of what we&#8217;re doing in Gutenberg and these new features. It helps at the end of the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, we&#8217;ll have to see what happens over on the Twitter side of things. We&#8217;re recording this episode at the ending of 2022 and a lot of flux, shall we say, over there at the moment. Let&#8217;s just see what happens. So it&#8217;s really curious though. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when we decided to have this podcast, we settled on the topic of, I&#8217;m just going to list them frankly. And then we can sort of dip into them one at a time or see where the conversation goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you decided that you wanted to speak to your passions I guess. So things like the new, I&#8217;m going to use that word, I don&#8217;t know for how much longer I&#8217;m going to be using it. But the new block themes. The style engine, which I&#8217;m, I frankly need explaining to me. Global styles, the ability to style everything in the future of WordPress. So styling blocks, themes, patterns, and so on. WordPress 6.1 and all of the fun things that that brought around. And maybe we&#8217;ll get into the new theme of 2023. Which offers some really interesting capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let&#8217;s just rewind the clock a little bit. Go back there to block themes and what have you. This is obviously something that you are excited about. They are new. I think for a lot of people, they still have a, beware, there be monsters kind of flag attached to them. You know, they&#8217;re happy with their customizer. They like the ability to change things in the way that they&#8217;ve always changed them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That menu area where you could fiddle, under appearances menus. That was fine. Can we just keep that please? And of course, WordPress is moving in a different direction where all of this is being handled by blocks. And so I want to know what you think about it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:03] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Sure. Again, my bias is as a front end developer. So, the themes have been the heart of where I spend most of my day for the past decade as a developer. That tends to be where my passions lie. So block themes are definitely the evolution of so many things I&#8217;ve seen in the WordPress project. Like you mentioned, the customizer. I think that it had great potential, but at the end of the day, there was far too much compatibility issues from switching from themes, and how theme developers were implementing custom fields into the customizer, and custom entry points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when users were switching, there was an inconsistency. So I see the evolution that is putting the hands back into the users where, that&#8217;s where a lot of the potential lies, or lied, with the customizer because theme developers could add these bells and whistles that end users could customize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the site editor is the evolution and, and in a lot of ways, I think there&#8217;s a revisiting of a lot of the APIs that were in the customizer but rethought in so many different ways, on so many different levels that they&#8217;re being abstracted and pulled apart. And so when they come back together, have so much more potential for developers and end users to extend, and build off of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it is a struggle because a lot of the underlying code base is being produced as we speak. And it&#8217;s going fast, and it&#8217;s hard to understand at times. Even, like you mentioned, and I put on the show notes style engine. That is totally new to me, and something that came on to my radar in the 6.1 release like a month ago. Because I had not even heard of this package that is in Gutenberg called the Style Engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I still don&#8217;t have a clear definition and understanding. But if I were to throw enough definition at it, I think it&#8217;s just a component of global styles, and really site editing to incorporate some of the classes that are used underneath in the code base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I know that a lot of feedback has been given about classes changing on certain elements and breaking things. And even the potential for builders to be able to assign custom classes to certain elements and have that spread throughout the whole site editing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think there is that drive in core to have those features, and the feedback is being heard. But it&#8217;s slow with great cause because there&#8217;s a lot of thought going into making sure it&#8217;s done right. So yeah, I think the style engine is a neat concept and I still am getting my head around a lot of it, but I think it&#8217;s got great potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. You mentioned a couple of things there, which I want to drill down on a little bit. The first one was the fact that the customizer offered an experience, which, for its day, I think was really ingenious. The ability to modify things and get a real time update. But of course, you are separating the area in which you can edit content from the area in which you interact with the way that the site looks, the styles and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How the fonts will look, and what the background color of your body is, and so on and so forth. But you said that it was being implemented by theme authors in a whole host of different ways. So if I download and use one theme, I may have a very different experience once I dig into the menus. Theme authors were really doing things in ingenious ways, let&#8217;s not deny it. It was also potentially, if you swapped a theme for a different one, you could be, I guess, disorientated because one theme author has done something absolutely differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s speak about that for a minute. Is the intention then you feel to make the whole experience, and I know we&#8217;re not there yet, the experience of the site editor, now called site editor, is still very confusing. But is the intention for it in the end, do you believe, to be one experience? The same experience, no matter what theme you end up using. You&#8217;re going to have a familiarity with the UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:40] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> The simple answer, yes I do. But I think that there will definitely be some rough areas. I see potential and abstraction enough in some of these packages that, there&#8217;s definitely enough thought that if a user were to switch themes in the site editor, you know that there will be a lot less breaking, a lot less confusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like you said, we&#8217;re certainly not there yet, but I think there&#8217;s a great, there&#8217;s enough thought and carefulness that&#8217;s going in consideration into the different packages and areas and features that make up site editing. So that the potential will be there that users can switch. But also users can switch and still maintain their customizations, right, within global styles. That&#8217;s a really complex thing to solve. But I think there&#8217;s definitely great consideration being applied there and making sure that that will happen. And so, yeah, I&#8217;m excited to see the future, that&#8217;s where it is for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I have no idea how to square this circle. I really don&#8217;t know how to do it. But the whole problem of putting the site editor into WordPress, and for everybody to go, yay, this is exactly what we wanted. Because we do seem to have an era, right at the minute where, people are adopting it, other people are finding it difficult to adopt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re holding off because they can see that it&#8217;s not where it needs to be. And I just don&#8217;t know what the solution could have been to make that transition as easy as possible. So we are in a situation right now where if you download a vanilla version of WordPress and put it on a site, you&#8217;re going to have the 2022 theme. But the editing experience for that will still be labeled as beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in a way, it&#8217;s sort of saying, whoa, don&#8217;t go in here. This is likely to break. So the default editing experience is warning us off and be mindful of the fact that things may be damaged if you use this. But the traditional way worked. People that were happy with it are still happy with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no period at which, hopefully, at least anyway, one is going to, the old way of doing things, if you like the classic themes, they&#8217;re not going to be put out to pasture at any point in the near future. So we&#8217;ve got try and swing people over gently. And I don&#8217;t know how that journey could have been achieved successfully, but it does feel as if maybe it&#8217;s put some people&#8217;s noses out of joint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course there&#8217;s this whole other crowd of people that we are not used to talking to because they don&#8217;t yet exist. And what I mean by that is people who&#8217;ve never used WordPress and for them, they&#8217;re going to step into WordPress tomorrow, the day after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this will be the way that they&#8217;ve done it. What the heck? The customizer. What? I have no interest in that. That looks very strange. I&#8217;m used to this experience and I guess part of your job and part of everybody&#8217;s job in WordPress is to sort of bridge that gap and see how smooth we can make it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:48] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Yeah, and I think that what excites me the most is the experimentation and exploration for even existing users. I mean, I think that some people are transitioning and exploring even new ways that even if they have the Gutenberg plugin installed and activated and are testing out things that aren&#8217;t ready for a production site necessarily, but really pushing the boundaries of what can be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, I think that can come back to influence the project and direction. So those edge cases and experimentations are definitely where things that get me excited. One thing I just saw that, it&#8217;s kind of a tangent I guess, but I saw that there&#8217;s a color randomizer that was introduced in Gutenberg, and I think that&#8217;s being, featured on, is it Anne McCarthy&#8217;s new call for full site editing outreach experiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, she does our outreach program. That&#8217;s right, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:46] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> So that is a really neat exploration to have in the global styles. A little button you can randomize the colors and see that being applied. You&#8217;ll see the different colors applied to the theme, and so I think that type of exploration shows some of the excitement and some of the neat things that there is potential for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also the people, I mean, and I am totally like, how many people are going to use that? I don&#8217;t know, maybe two. But I think that that type of exploration can give great value if done carefully and considered what the outcomes are, and what the potential is. Whether that feature gets pulled into a final solution and product of WordPress core, I don&#8217;t know, that may not. But I&#8217;m sure that the outcomes will be documented, whether it&#8217;s in Gutenberg and whether that comes back up in two or three years as another exploration, you know. That&#8217;s something to learn from and build off of. So that stuff is, I think, super valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s a really interesting position you&#8217;ve taken there. I really hadn&#8217;t framed it in my head in that way too often, because when something like that comes along, it would seem that those people who aren&#8217;t going to make any use of it, the common clarion call is, well, who&#8217;s going to make use of it? What&#8217;s the point of this? Why have we got this, I don&#8217;t know, style randomizer that you&#8217;ve just mentioned? And, maybe the same could be true of things like the duotone option that was available. I haven&#8217;t really seen too much of the duotone out there in the wild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I&#8217;m taking from that is that it was an interesting experiment. Nobody, well, not nobody, very few people made use of it. But the way that you just framed it was fascinating. It was more about, well let&#8217;s just try things. Throw spaghetti at the wall, and see what sticks. And maybe some of it is going to be the exact thing first time, but maybe not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;ll be a case of, what we&#8217;ve shown you here is what is possible, not how it will end up. Look, there is an option here. By clicking a button, you can dramatically change the style of your site, you can randomize it. But what if we didn&#8217;t want to randomize it completely? What if we could apply constraints to that randomization, so that it was broadly the same as it was before, but just a tiny bit different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, we varied your website, not completely randomized it. And so it can be iterated on. The goal isn&#8217;t to arrive at the end point, first time. It&#8217;s just, here&#8217;s an idea. Anybody going to make use of it? No, okay. We&#8217;ll move on. Or, yes, but not how it is. We&#8217;re going to iterate on it, so, yeah interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:25] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Yeah, they&#8217;re experiments. I mean, it&#8217;s like good old science class. You do an experiment, document the outcomes. And I think that&#8217;s a really great way to look at it. Not everything is going to be a success. Experiments fail all the time. But, just as long as you can kinda learn and get the key takeaways and maybe revisit and iterate on a different type of that experiment. So yeah, I think it&#8217;s a great thing,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Showing the boundaries of what might be possible, not necessarily what will be. Here&#8217;s the sort of thing that you can do. Here&#8217;s the direction that you could go in and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like styles, you were mentioning there the ability to randomize them. I feel like styles is a real area of success in WordPress at the minute. Because we&#8217;ve got things like global styles in the latest iteration of the default theme, 2023. We&#8217;ve got this fabulous new thing, which certainly I think is fabulous, I think you do too, called style variations. Other things perhaps less successful. You know, the navigation block, I think still is broadly speaking too unfamiliar for many people to use it as a default. But yeah, styles. Styling everything, blocks, themes, patterns, and what have you, and style variations. Do you just want to tell us, because you wrote that in the show notes, you must have some, insight and excitement around it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:49] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Yeah, style variations, I think that came out in 5.9 or maybe 6.0. With 6.1 that just came out, the core theme 2023 had a series of style variations within it. That was showing the potential of that new API. And again it&#8217;s a great exploration and I don&#8217;t think that every theme that&#8217;s going to be developed, or need to be developed, is going to need a style variation. But, the fact that those APIs are there and you can have that UI, that a user can just browse through and pick different styles and appearances, and get different looks to their site. I think is always something that&#8217;s going to land with developers and end users. Because yeah, the web is a big visual experience for a lot of us. So just seeing those changes in real life is always a great thing. And, there was about 10 style variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so yeah, if you open up the 2023 theme and go into the global styles area, you can just browse different appearances and even save, if you like one, and start using it today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It really is remarkably clever and very, very interesting to look at. So, as you&#8217;ve just said, you download, start using the 2023 theme, and you&#8217;ve got these 10 contributed style variations. And really, in a sense, it&#8217;s almost like a theme within a theme. It&#8217;s almost like the 2023 theme is 10 themes. I&#8217;m over exaggerating it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It really is just changing the styling. So the text is the same. The images, they remain the same. But it plays very nicely, like I said, these 10 contributed styles that were selected as the ones to go into the theme, they&#8217;re really, really different to each other. So in some of them the images, they have different border radiuss, you know, really startlingly, different border radiuss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The typography&#8217;s changed, the background has changed. And for an end user, you are basically looking at a different website. And the ability to change that, I can&#8217;t see any people, well any clients, not at least thinking, well that&#8217;s a nice option to have. Nobody&#8217;s going to say, well, no, no. I don&#8217;t wish to ever be able to change the style of my website with the click of a button. That&#8217;s just such a great idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:15] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Yeah. And I think it, that even reinforces a lot of, I know that the introduction of the theme.json, right, using json file to right. A lot of people say, and it is if you&#8217;re essentially writing kind of a CSS abstraction, right, of styling your site in theme.json files. But I think that&#8217;s where, again I see the potential is. Yeah, you&#8217;re saving these styles as json objects, but you know, at the end of the day there&#8217;s so much more potential that, you know, you can take different json objects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s styling the same exact thing. Maybe the theme is saying style buttons this way with this border, and then there&#8217;s a UI for the user to modify that border, and then take those json objects and synthesize them together. That is the potential of, again, going back to the customizer, if a user just switched themes and some of those stylings weren&#8217;t there, then they had a bad experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think the value of the theme.json file is hard for a lot of people to grasp, because especially if you&#8217;re familiar with writing CSS, you&#8217;re like, oh, I&#8217;m just writing CSS in a json file. But, yes you are. But, the way that data is being exchanged and can be exchanged in the future will have great potential and, really enable a lot of clever things, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just to give some more context to that. Does the theme json file, for those people who are listening who don&#8217;t know what that is and don&#8217;t really want to get into that. Fear not, it&#8217;s not tremendously difficult, but also I think there&#8217;s a lot of tooling coming out, which is online platforms if you like, which will help you get through that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of tutorials around now to help with that, much more so than there was a little while ago. But there are tools which are coming out which will enable you to create these files in a much more straightforward way than typing it into your IDE. But do you see that as a really nice bridge between swapping out themes, because it will provide consistency over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things in the theme.json file will be immutable, if you like. And if you swap your theme for a completely different theme, hopefully, you won&#8217;t just be looking at a complete horror show where everything is completely different. We&#8217;re looking for a more consistent experience with these new adoptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:39] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Yeah, I think my mind definitely goes to the edge cases, well not the edge cases, but like AI. I mean you kind of have to make some inferences of if you&#8217;re going to take what the theme, it might be telling you, and trying to allow the user to override some of the things the theme might be setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, you want, you want to make that optional, right? You want to be able to allow theme developers to even surface the UI. So, do they want the potential for somebody to change a button border? That should be an option. And if it&#8217;s enabled, how do we infer what the user has customized versus what the theme originally was doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you can kind of make some inferences there, but at the end of the day, there&#8217;ll probably be some rough edges that will break in changing themes. But I think that it has a greater potential in the current iteration of it, like the APIs with theme.json ,to make things easier to work with, and how they&#8217;re saved and exchanged. So, I&#8217;m not sure if that answered your question, but.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s not the silver bullet, but it hopefully will provide a little bit of stability over time. And be less of a, of an experience that you described earlier with the customizer where swap themes and you really are left with a black hole that is hard to get out of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so we&#8217;re recording this end of November, 2022. WordPress 6.1. Actually 6.1.1 as of a few hours ago. But, broadly speaking, WordPress 6.1 is the latest and greatest. You put in the show notes, the future of WordPress including 6.1 and beyond. What has got you excited in 6.1? What are some of the, the fun bells and whistles that you&#8217;ve enjoyed seeing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:34] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> I think some of the global styles work, like saving and importing and exporting for themes to allow end users and builders to create their own variations on a theme. That is currently being worked on, and I think has great potential and excites me. So that, again, it goes back to enabling a good theme switching experience for the end user and for builders and for developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I think there&#8217;s also more, I mean, in 6.1 there was a good deal of work in allowing the bridge between classic themes and block themes with allowing classic template parts to pull in patterns. And, even now I think there&#8217;s work for replacing a template part from patterns. Those types of things speak to the backwards compatibility of the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That stuff excites me the most is bridging that gap, because I think a lot of people are, it&#8217;s either a classic theme world or a block theme world. And so, if we can slowly onboard users and developers from classic theme to block theme development, then I think that&#8217;s always going to be a success for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You, uh, you mentioned also in the show notes. One of the things that people listening to this may or may not know, is, they may have come across a plugin before called ACF. ACF stands for Advanced Custom Fields. I forget when, it was certainly before your time at WP Engine, but WP Engine acquired ACF. And, I can&#8217;t remember the route that it went. I think it went through Delicious Brains first, and then it ended up with WP Engine. It&#8217;s now under WP Engine&#8217;s stewardship. It&#8217;s a very popular plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the fun things that you can do with ACF is to create blocks in, let&#8217;s just call it a simpler way. There&#8217;s less of a curve. You can stick with some of the things that you&#8217;ve known for years. You mentioned in the show notes you thought this was quite an interesting thing that you&#8217;ve been playing with lately. Tell us a little bit about ACF blocks and what you&#8217;ve been doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:40] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Yeah, I recently was able to revisit because I&#8217;ve used, I&#8217;ve been an ACF Pro user throughout my years as a developer and I&#8217;ve used it on projects and, it had been a while and the 6.0 release just came out. And so I was able to dig in and experiment with the current iteration of ACF blocks, which has great potential, I think, and is really useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, I think it bridges a gap for a lot of builders in creating custom blocks. I think it&#8217;s become a less of a need, because I think WordPress core has enough great blocks out of the box to use. But there&#8217;s always going to be potential for different accordions, tabs, those good old sliders, stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And ACF definitely makes a great argument for using PHP and not even having to dabble in kind of the Gutenberg React, JavaScript world. So I think that makes sense for a lot of developers. Why start learning all this React stuff when I can just stick with PHP, and that makes sense to me. And I think that whatever gets you an end project done quicker than that, whatever works, that works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So is the idea of ACF blocks then that with an understanding of PHP, CSS and what have you? You can combine custom field groups, say, or a selection of custom fields. And you can have those be output in a block? So you&#8217;re in the Gutenberg editor, you drag in the ACF block that you&#8217;ve created, and whatever you&#8217;ve given it a name for. And then you can style it in Gutenberg based upon what you&#8217;ve set up. You can obviously, depending on what you&#8217;ve done, you can add in text or multiline text or date pickers or whatever it may be. Is that the promise of it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:43] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Yeah, and I think for any ACF users that are already working with the field&#8217;s UI, registering and creating those fields in ACF and then assigning them to a custom block that you can just drag and drop into the editor, is quick and easy with ACF. And it makes sense in a lot of ways, because yeah, those fields are available in your block and you get the output that you expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there&#8217;s a little bit of a deviation in kind of the editor experience, because the way the fields, but that&#8217;s really on the developer and implementation really. I mean, you can go all out and try to make it a native feeling experience. And I think that there&#8217;s a lot of work even in ACF to give it that native experience. But yeah, I think having those fields available right on your block in the editor makes things easy to work with and makes sense at the end of the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s a nice bridge isn&#8217;t it, for people who don&#8217;t wish to commit the time or the energy to learning those fairly difficult skills. You can stick with the skills that you&#8217;ve already got and use perhaps a tool that you&#8217;ve had lying around for a while in a new and interesting way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also feel that the idea of being able to drop in custom blocks for your clients, whatever industry they&#8217;re in. I don&#8217;t know, you build a site for a real estate agent and managed to throw together a real estate block, which, you know, if you fill out the fields, there&#8217;s a house, that you can have on your website and all you had to do was drag in a block and complete the necessary fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really great. Really interesting. Do you actually dabble in the, the React side of things? Do you build your own custom blocks? Is that something you have experimented with? And if the answer&#8217;s yes, how have you found that challenge?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:31] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Yes I do. And it is a challenge. I think that I tend to bounce between trying to learn React fundamentals, but mostly I think that I spend most of my time learning Gutenberg&#8217;s flavour of React, which makes more sense to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And makes more sense in that, it&#8217;s in WordPress and that&#8217;s the APIs that they&#8217;re spinning off is going to always, it&#8217;s going to mature and change a little bit, but that&#8217;s where I&#8217;d rather spend my time learning. But I think there are some key concepts in React fundamentals that it&#8217;s always good to go back and revisit. But, I do that sporadically. That&#8217;s even, uh, as a front end developer of 10 years, I still, you know, I&#8217;m still looking up HTML elements in MDN Mozilla.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, developing custom blocks I think has become a lot easier because I&#8217;ve developed them throughout the years in agency land and just the tooling has become a lot better and consistent. Still a ways to go in the documentation. And I think there&#8217;s a, a lot of great feedback on how to extend some of the tools to help enable custom block development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I think it&#8217;s come a long way and, there is the barrier to creating your first block is pretty low these days. And if anything, the biggest barriers are probably spinning up and setting up Node and NPM, which is understandably a pretty significant technical barrier. But, I think there&#8217;s a lot of great tutorials out there on that stuff as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Given that your developer advocate role is your job, and you&#8217;re trying to bridge the gap, I guess, you&#8217;re trying to find ways to promote the community and help the community and so on. Are there any resources that you have found particularly useful? You mentioned that there&#8217;s more now than there ever has been, which is great, but are there any resources that you have personally found to be very useful about anything that we&#8217;ve talked about today? Whether that&#8217;s blocks, style variations, block themes, block patterns, whatever, just stuff that you&#8217;ve found to be useful, resources that we can mention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:54] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Yeah, I think the Learn Team and learn.wordpress.org has been putting out some great material. Courses, video tutorials. So I think that has been a really great resource lately. Also, Carolina&#8217;s fullsiteediting.com. I think a lot of people find that very useful. She does a great job of keeping that up to date and so much, so much great resources there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only other, and I know this isn&#8217;t probably what everybody does with their free time, but, I actually find it interesting to open up GitHub and go into the Gutenberg project and just pick a package and start looking at code. But not everybody is a coder and not everybody&#8217;s a developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, along those lines, I think if you are even on an early journey and have any interest in being a developer, I would focus more on just learning HTML and CSS. Then if you do someday want to open up Gutenberg and start looking at the code, I think that to have that background is, is far more important to get you into the larger stuff that goes on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Damon, I am wondering if people have listened to this episode and they&#8217;ve thought, I would like to talk to Damon about this. Where could we find you? What social platforms do you use, or email address do you want to disclose? Entirely up to you. As much or as little as you like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:24] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Hopefully Twitter is still very active. But that&#8217;s where I do spend a lot of my time still. So I am dcook on Twitter. So definitely reach out to me there. And I think I&#8217;m always in the WordPress Slack. Definitely lots of great content coming out of wpengine.com builders site in the future. We&#8217;re actually just starting to do some workshops as well. So look for announcements on Twitter through wpenginebuilders. That&#8217;s where mostly where I can be reached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Damon Cook, appreciate you chatting to us on the podcast today. Thank you very much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:03] <strong>Damon Cook:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today, we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dcook\">Damon Cook</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s a longtime user of WordPress, trying it first in around 2008. He’s worked for some of the largest WordPress agencies over the years, but his current role is that of Developer Advocate with WP Engine, where he engages with the WordPress community, trying to figure out where WordPress is headed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Damon is on the podcast to talk about styling WordPress, and how it’s changing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until recently, if you wanted to modify your website’s appearance, you needed to work with the theme. Sometimes this could be done in the theme’s UI or in the WordPress Customizer, but if you really needed fine control, then it’s likely you edited the theme’s files or created a theme of your own. It can be quite a complex process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block-based themes are revolutionising website styling. You’re going to be able to change any aspect of your website from the UI that you’re familiar with. The hope is that it’ll make styling more accessible to a wider audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Damon talks about the fact that we’re in a period of flux right now. The documentation and tooling needed to work with website styles is maturing, but is by no means complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk through some new concepts which are underpinning all of this. Style variations, style engine, global styles, block themes, block patterns, theme.json. These are perhaps terms that you’ve heard being used, but might not be familiar with. Damon explains what they are and where they fit into the website styling jigsaw.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end we briefly get into work that Damon has been doing with ACF to make his own blocks, and how it provides a bridge for those people who are not yet familiar with React.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpengine.com/\">WP Engine</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpengine.com/builders/\">WP Engine Builders</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://deliciousbrains.com/\">Delicious Brains</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/\">Advanced Custom Fields</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/\">ACF Blocks</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fullsiteediting.com/\">Full site editing website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg\">Gutenberg Project on GitHub</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Jan 2023 15:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"Do The Woo Community: The Process for Applying to the WooCommerce Agency Partner Program\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=74212\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://dothewoo.io/the-process-for-applying-to-the-woocommerce-agency-partner-program/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:394:\"<p>A simple explanation of the process for applying as a WooExpert </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/the-process-for-applying-to-the-woocommerce-agency-partner-program/\">The Process for Applying to the WooCommerce Agency Partner Program</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Jan 2023 10:32:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"WPTavern: Icon Block 1.4.0 Adds Height Control, Improves Color Handling to Better Support Global Styles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=140670\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"https://wptavern.com/icon-block-1-4-0-adds-height-control-improves-color-handling-to-better-support-global-styles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5873:\"<p>Nick Diego, developer advocate at WP Engine, has released <a href=\"https://nickdiego.com/the-icon-block-1-4-0-release-whats-new-and-how-i-built-it/\">version 1.4.0</a> of his <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/icon-block/\">Icon Block</a> plugin. Diego launched it in October 2021, after struggling to find an efficient way to add SVG icons to the block editor. He is aiming for this small but useful plugin to become &#8220;the definitive SVG icon and graphic block.&#8221; In the past year, it has grown 1300%  to more than 7,000 active installs, while staying focused on a tight set of features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress contributors have been <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24251\">discussing adding SVG support</a> to core for more than a decade, but have not yet found a clear path forward that properly addresses security concerns. In July 2022, the Performance team began <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-performance-team-is-working-on-a-module-for-svg-uploads\">working on a module for SVG uploads</a> but it&#8217;s still in progress. In the meantime, since the SVG format has <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/?search=svg\">nearly universal support across the web</a>, users have relied on plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/svg-support/\">SVG Support</a> (1M+ installs) or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/safe-svg/\">Safe SVG</a> (700k+ installs) to upload SVG files to the media library and use them like any other image file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diego&#8217;s plugin is different in that it was made for use with the block and site editors. The Icon Block registers a single block that allows users to add custom SVG icons and graphics. It also enables access to the WordPress icon library, which contains 270+ SVG icons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One advantage of the plugin is that users don&#8217;t need to install a whole block library if they just need SVG icons. In version 1.2.0, Icon Block added the ability for developers to <a href=\"https://nickdiego.com/adding-custom-icons-to-the-icon-block/\">register their own custom icon libraries</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest release expands width control beyond what is offered in the core Image block to support <code>%</code>, <code>px</code>, <code>em</code>, <code>rem</code>, <code>vh</code>, <code>vw</code>, or whatever units are defined in theme.json. These units are also available in Global Styles, so users can control width based on how the theme author intended. Diego, who said he prefers to use native WordPress components wherever possible, updated width controls using Gutenberg&#8217;s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/packages/block-editor/src/components/height-control/index.js\" target=\"_blank\">HeightControl</a>, which isn&#8217;t yet available in core. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Luckily, it is built out of components that have been in WordPress since 6.0. I ported the code from the <code>HeightControl</code> over to a custom <code><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/ndiego/icon-block/blob/main/src/components/dimension-control.js\" target=\"_blank\">DimensionControl</a></code> in the Icon Block and made a few modifications to meet my specific needs,&#8221; Diego said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Icon height support is a new feature in the latest 1.4.0 release, another feature request from the plugin&#8217;s community of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image source: <a href=\"https://nickdiego.com/the-icon-block-1-4-0-release-whats-new-and-how-i-built-it/\">Icon Block 1.4.0 release post</a>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One thing to note is that I choose to exclude&nbsp;<code>%</code>&nbsp;from the height unit options,&#8221; Diego said in the release post. &#8220;Using&nbsp;<code>%</code>&nbsp;can have unexpected results based on the icon’s container height and is quite unintuitive.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 1.4.0 also improves color support to better support Global Styles. When themes define a <code><code>primary</code> and <code>secondary</code></code> colors in theme.json, icons set to use these will work seamlessly with style variation switching. This is a beautiful demonstration of how block developers can make their plugins work harmoniously with Global Styles to improve the experience of full-site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image source: <a href=\"https://nickdiego.com/the-icon-block-1-4-0-release-whats-new-and-how-i-built-it/\">Icon Block 1.4.0 release post</a>\n\n\n\n<p>In future releases, Diego said he plans to work on a way to allow users to insert custom SVG icons from an &#8220;uploaded&#8221; SVG file, as well as explore ways to integrate with third-party icon libraries. Access to Font Awesome, Boostrap icons, Ionicons, and other SVG libraries would give users a much wider selection beyond the WordPress icon library when designing their sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can submit feature requests via the <a href=\"https://github.com/ndiego/icon-block/issues\">issues</a> queue in the plugin&#8217;s GitHub repository. Since Diego is developing the plugin using native WordPress components as much as possible, users can also expect additional functionality to become available as it is added to WordPress core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are tons of great icon plugins in the WordPress ecosystem, free and premium,&#8221; Diego said. &#8220;Most have more features and functionality than the Icon Block. However, what makes this block different is its strong commitment to WordPress&#8217; core design principles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The goal was always to make the block feel like it belonged in WordPress itself. I have strived to use as many core <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-supports/\" target=\"_blank\">block supports</a> and components as possible. Version 1.4.0 stays true to this effort with much-needed enhancements.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 03 Jan 2023 21:36:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"Do The Woo Community: Knowing What Your Sites Performance Means\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=74171\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://dothewoo.io/knowing-what-your-sites-performance-means/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:439:\"<p>You may find a tool that gives you a good indication of what your site does in a browser, but it\'s just a metric.

Actually, two requests will be sent:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A request for the wp-json embed for the page.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A request for the page that was shared.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, he blocked the Mastodon user agent. That stops previews of his website showing up on Mastodon posts, but resolves the problem for his website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday morning, I <a href=\"https://mastodon.ie/@donncha/109614145566437712\">decided to see what effect</a> sharing a link on my Mastodon account would have on my server. My Mastodon account has 1.8K followers. A far cry from the number of followers JWZ has, but still enough to test my server.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to test several scenarios:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Caching the post before sharing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Changing Apache configuration.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sharing without caching on my server.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>My server is at Linode. I pay an average of $24/month to run this site and my photoblog is on it too where I share a daily photo + link on Mastodon. It&#8217;s not a heavy-duty server that can withstand a huge amount of traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to skip the details, my server coped fine with sharing a URL from here to Mastodon. The load average went up for about 20 seconds, topping out at the max for about 5 seconds before things calmed down. It was responsive the whole time. Install a full-page caching plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/\">WP Super Cache</a>, <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/boost/\">Jetpack Boost</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rest-cache/\">WP Rest Cache</a> and your site will probably be fine. Jetpack Boost and the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack</a> Image Accelerator will help when human visitors arrive.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/odd.blog/files/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-02-at-10.03.17.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></div>\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://mastodon.ie/@donncha/109614168671378154\">first test</a> resulted in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>261 requests for the page embed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>359 requests for the page itself.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1 minute load average topped out at 1.34 for 5 seconds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The page was cached by WP Super Cache, but I had set the garbage collection TTL to 60 seconds and I believe it expired halfway through the test, so it had to generate the cache again. Once I adjusted that, and set the TTL to 600 seconds, <a href=\"https://mastodon.ie/@donncha/109614227575646081\">the second test</a> performed better. The page remained cached throughout:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>273 requests for the page embed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>289 requests for the page itself.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1 minute load average topped out at 0.71 for 5 seconds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The main points of my Apache configuration:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Keep alives are disabled.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5 start servers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimum 10 spare servers</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When I reduced the start and minimum spare servers to 1, <a href=\"https://mastodon.ie/@donncha/109614274892094213\">the next test</a> took longer to complete, and the load average rose to 1.24, even on a fully cached page. This was expected as the server didn&#8217;t have the spare capacity to deal with the sudden traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After reverting the changes to Apache, I disabled caching on my blog and shared another URL. The <a href=\"https://mastodon.ie/@donncha/109614344675460069\">load average</a> only rose to 1.12 for a very short time. I was pleased with that. While caching does help, my server could cope with that traffic.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/odd.blog/files/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-02-at-09.57.25.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>A sample of the user agents used by Mastodon instances hitting my blog for previews</div>\n\n\n<p>I suspected that there was one hit per Mastodon instance on my site. I checked my logs and was proved right. For all the accounts that follow me on mastodon.social, only one request was made. That does mean the onslaught of requests isn&#8217;t as bad as it might be. Instead of 1,800 requests for a page, there were far fewer. I did notice that a Friendica instance requested one of my test URLs several times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mastodon and other Fediverse servers will start requesting a preview within a second of you sharing your post on the network. It helps if your server is running some sort of caching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have many Mastodon followers or if you&#8217;re worried about a DDoS from Mastodon, the following will help:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure Apache/Nginx has the spare capacity to grow quickly and respond to a sudden torrent of requests.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Install a caching plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/\">WP Super Cache</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use “expert caching” in WP Super Cache which serves the cached page using mod_rewrite. That will mean your blog post is served almost as fast as requesting a text file from the server. No PHP is executed at all.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rest-cache/\">WP Rest Cache</a> as it will <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/get-wp-json-oembed-not-cached-can-it-be/\">soon cache the embed page request</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack</a> and enable the Image Accelerator and Jetpack Boost for human visitors who come later.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This problem has existed for a long time. Popular blogs had the same issue when they published new content and people following their blogs (through RSS feed readers, remember them?) hit the server looking for the new post. At least with Mastodon, you can load the post in a private browser window and cache it before sharing it. I want to write a WP Super Cache add-on plugin that allows the site owner to preload a new post as it&#8217;s published. That will ensure the new content is ready for sharing. I haven&#8217;t started work on that yet, so don&#8217;t ask when it&#8217;ll be done. Maybe someone else will beat me to it and claim all the credit!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 02 Jan 2023 09:31:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Donncha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 46: The WP Bloopers Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=14123\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/12/episode-46-the-wp-bloopers-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9573:\"<p>This episode of the WP Briefing features all the Josepha bloopers our little elves have stored away over the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

This is the thing I&#8217;ve done 25 times, and I know how to do it for reals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to WordPress Briefing, episode 20. Oh no, 7? 27? 26? Episode 27. I know how many things I&#8217;ve done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ooh, neat. This is Josepha recording episode 46 of the WP Bonus Briefings. Not because we&#8217;ve had 46 bonus Briefings, but because this is the 46th one and it is a bonus, it will also have a fancy name. But right now, I&#8217;m just calling it the bonus. It&#8217;s gonna be quick. Here I go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group them into two big buckets, themes, uh, themes and tools. Mmm, I&#8217;m gonna have to redo the whole thing! No! I thought I could save it, and I didn&#8217;t save it. I had a typo in my script, and then I messed it up. I, it said into you big buckets instead of into two big buckets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna start over from the target release date because I kind of smeared it all together, um, despite what I intended to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And gives everyone, no. What is this ringing of phones? Oh, I was doing so well. Where was I? Let&#8217;s see if I can just pick it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All righty, live from my closet. It&#8217;s episode 20, the WordPress Briefing, WP Briefing. So I have a title for this, and when I started writing it, I really had every intention of writing it to the title. And then what I wrote doesn&#8217;t fit the title at all, but does really hang together well. And so we&#8217;re gonna have to come up with a new title, but at the moment, it&#8217;s called So Many Ways to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here in a minute, you will see why it doesn&#8217;t fit. Also, at the end, I feel like I get very, like, angry nerd leader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:00]&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I may, I may at the end, give that a second go and see if there&#8217;s a way that I can soften it a little bit, but, I, I don&#8217;t know that I can soften it. I feel very strongly about it. So, maybe I am just an angry nerd leader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, okay. I&#8217;ll get us started now that I apparently have filled the room with apologies, not the room, the closet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll figure out something very catchy as a title or as an alternative. Very descriptive, and people will click on it because they must know, but we&#8217;ll figure out the title later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>@wordpress.org. However, I don&#8217;t know why I decided to do an invitation to email me in the middle of that. I&#8217;m gonna start from the top of that paragraph. I just got too excited by the opportunity to get mail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I gotta slow it down. I&#8217;m like the fastest talker, had too much coffee. Okay, slowing it down now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huh? What am I saying? No, no, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying. It&#8217;s fine. I, I can do this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:00]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold on. Oww. Sorry. I was adjusting my microphone, and then it fell down. I happened to be holding it at the time, so it didn&#8217;t, like, slam down, I think, and hurt your ears and so I apologize. Good thing I stopped so it didn&#8217;t just, like, slam down in the middle of a recording.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;m gonna give myself that win, even though it&#8217;s a hollow one. All right. Trying again. Starting right there, at now since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, it starts on October 18th, 2001. That&#8217;s the year? No, 2021. That&#8217;s the year. Oh man. I&#8217;m doing such a great job of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I&#8217;m recording this slightly before, um, you&#8217;re hearing it? What, how am I gonna start this? Hold on. I don&#8217;t know how to start this. All right. I&#8217;m, I can do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;m so glad I remembered. We had guests that could have been so embarrassing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now for me, the trade-offs work well. How many times can I say now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do I just start every sentence with now now? Is this just how I do things? Uh, now, now, now, now. I&#8217;m gonna start all over again because I&#8217;m in my head about the words in my mouth now. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some near timeframe, some near timeframe. This is not a thing that people say, Dustin, I&#8217;m sorry. That&#8217;s not a thing people say. I&#8217;m just gonna retry that one sentence to sound like I speak with other human beings sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is the start of… I can do these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a terrible ending. I need to just finish that last part. I&#8217;m gonna redo the part where I started with my name and not the name of the podcast. Um, and we&#8217;ll do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re supporting or building anything to hand off to clients, you know that timely, easy to ship changes on a site are considered a vital part of any overarching brand and marketing strategy. Wow. It&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know what words are right there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tripped over my own tongue a lot. I&#8217;m gonna sit, I&#8217;m gonna do that paragraph again because I didn&#8217;t do a very good job of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll do a better job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I literally digress, and now I don&#8217;t know. I am in my thing. What was I saying? Oh, there we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Topher DeRosia, who founded Word not WordPress. Holy moly. That was a, I knew I was gonna say that, and I was like, don&#8217;t say that when you actually get around to saying this, but here I am, and I did it. Even though I knew I was gonna do it and I told myself not to. Doing it again. Right from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not which audiench segment. Oh man. Audiench is not a word, folks. I was on a roll. I&#8217;m gonna start right from the primary thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t even remember how I started this podcast. What is the last thing I said? I said, here we go. All right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kind of covered some interesting ground, and so, oh no, this is not where I&#8217;m gonna start it. I know exactly where I&#8217;m gonna start it. Okay. I&#8217;m really ready now. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suddenly, I&#8217;m gonna pause right here because I suddenly got really worried that I didn&#8217;t actually hit record. Oh my gosh. I did. Woo. I&#8217;m all over the place. Okay. We&#8217;ll now continue. Wait, did I? Oh my goodness. I did, super sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m gonna do some singing in the middle of some talking, but I keep trying to talk myself out of the singing, so I&#8217;m gonna go ahead and do the singing, and then I&#8217;ll do the talking before I talk myself out of the singing. Here I go, probably.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I added a word. That was so good. I&#8217;m gonna start again. I&#8217;m gonna get some water, and then I&#8217;m gonna start again. Not again. Again. Just from the ‘and finally.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how I finish my show. Y&#8217;all, I do this literally every week. I never know how to finish my show. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know why I shouted at you from the other side of the tiny closet. I apologize. I&#8217;m gonna start again from ‘and finally.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tada we did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ha. I hate it. I hate the whole podcast. It&#8217;s gonna be fine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Done. Nailed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that, I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Merry Christmas from me.

They were <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2022/12/16/plugins-themes-categorization/\">live on WordPress.org</a> last week and plugin and theme authors were invited to opt into the categorization. The categories are visible in the sidebar of the listings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the example below, Akismet, Automattic&#8217;s commercial spam plugin that is bundled with WordPress, has the new Commercial category applied, indicating it is free but offers additional paid commercial upgrades or support. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The categories do not yet seem to be as widely applied to themes, but one example is all the default themes fall under the &#8220;Community Theme&#8221; designation, indicating that they are developed and supported by a community as opposed to being a part of a commercial endeavor.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>There are currently just two categories, but meta contributor Samuel (Otto) Wood said this effort is &#8220;the start of a broader categorization of plugins and themes.&#8221; He outlined how plugin and theme authors can opt into the new categorization feature:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>To opt in a plugin or theme, email&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:plugins@wordpress.org\">plugins@wordpress.org</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:themes@wordpress.org\">themes@wordpress.org</a>, and simply ask to opt into it. This is a manual process for now. In the future, we will be adding a method for plugins and themes to do it themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your plugin or theme is added, you will get a new feature (on the advanced tab for plugins, or at the bottom of the listing page for themes). For both cases, it’s a simple&nbsp;URL&nbsp;entry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For Commercial extensions the URL is a support link. Community extension URLs will be labeled as a contribute link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several participants in the comments of the announcement suggested that commercial-tagged&nbsp;plugins and themes should also have the option to include a &#8220;contribute&#8221; link since they are open source software. Wood&#8217;s response seems to indicate the URL is more about where to direct support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is a matter of categorization,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Community plugins are those that are mainly supported by a community of users. Commercial plugins are those primarily supported by a commercial profit-seeking entity.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once these categorizations are more widely adopted, it will be interesting to see if the theme and plugin directories will add the ability to filter search results using these tags. This would allow users to narrow down the results to be in line with their expectations for support. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 04:46:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 14.8 Overhauls Site Editor Interface, Adds Style Book\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=140536\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-14-8-overhauls-site-editor-interface-adds-style-book\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4073:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/12/22/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-8-21-december/\">Gutenberg 14.8</a> was released today with a major update to the Site Editor&#8217;s interface that makes it feel more unified as a design tool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In August, Gutenberg designer James Koster shared some mockups for <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/james-koster-shares-design-explorations-that-transform-wordpress-site-editor-into-a-more-visual-user-friendly-tool\">updating the Site Editor to include a “navigable frame”</a> where users can select from a menu of features and styles on the left. This was one answer to what Koster identified as unbalanced feature weighting, a critical design flaw that he said was negatively impacting users’ experience with the editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October, contributors began <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-explore-a-new-browse-mode-for-navigating-the-site-editor\">moving this idea forward</a>, and now the first iteration of the new &#8220;browse mode&#8221; is making its debut in Gutenberg 14.8. Automattic-sponsored contributor Ryan Welcher published a video demonstrating the new UI for navigating the Site Editor:</p>\n\n\n\nvideo credit: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/12/22/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-8-21-december/\">Gutenberg 14.8</a> release post\n\n\n\n<p>Version 14.8 also introduces Style Block, which is now nestled into the Global Styles panel. It offers a way to visualize how global style changes will affect blocks by previewing them (both core and third-party blocks) in a resizable panel. This is especially useful when a theme has many style variations that would otherwise be time intensive to save and then preview with various blocks. It helps users answer the question, &#8220;How are these styles going to look with my blocks?&#8221; Styles can also be <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/45719\">previewed for individual blocks</a>.</p>\n\n\n\nvideo credit: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/12/22/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-8-21-december/\">Gutenberg 14.8</a> release post\n\n\n\n<p>Users who have been missing the Custom CSS panel from the Customizer will be delighted to know that Gutenberg 14.8 adds custom CSS to the <strong>Styles > Custom</strong> panel in the Site Editor. This first iteration is shipping as Experimental, so users who want to test it can enable &#8220;Global styles custom CSS&#8221; under the Gutenberg > Experiments menu in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When checking out patterns in the inserter, hovering over a pattern will now reveal its title. The  invisibility of pattern titles <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/45595\">becomes an issue when patterns are visually similar to one another</a> with slight variations. Having the title be visible helps users sort through and select the best pattern for their needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The Navigation block has several updates that should improve the experience of building and editing menus:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Navigation block: Add page list to Link&nbsp;UI&nbsp;transforms in Nav block. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/46426\">46426</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Navigation block: Add location-&gt;primary to fallback nav creation for classic menus. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/45976\">45976</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Navigation block: Update fallback nav creation to the most recently created menu. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/46286\">46286</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Navigation block: Add a ‘open list view’ button. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/46335\">46335</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Navigation block: Removes the header from the navigation list view in the experiment. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/46070\">46070</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 14.8 includes dozens of enhancements and bug fixes beyond these highlights.

As usual, this was delivered by our project co-founder Matt Mullenweg and represented a year-long labor of love from the WordPress community as a whole. There are many things I love about State of the Word, but consistently the thing I love the most is being able to shine spotlights on the great work of our global network of contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since that presentation goes by at the speed of light, I wanted to highlight a few things as well. First things first, I wanted to highlight that we had nearly 1,400 contributors, and by nearly, I mean just one too few. We had 1,399 contributors. So that is a big deal in general, but it&#8217;s an especially big deal to me because that&#8217;s before we start looking at any contributions that aren&#8217;t specifically tied to a release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be wondering what those non-release contributions are. An incomplete list of those contributions would include organizing WordPress events, training others how to use WordPress, the myriad podcasts, articles, and newsletters that make up the WordPress media community, and any participant in a call for testing. Not to mention the unglamorous ways to contribute, like reviewing themes or reviewing plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things like patching security vulnerabilities and the bazillion things that Meta does to make sure that our community has all the tools that it needs to function. So I want to echo, once again, the huge, huge thanks that Matt already shared in State of the Word, and thank all of you for showing up for our project and for each other this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing I wanted to be sure to highlight was LearnWP. It was briefly noted that 12,000 learners had found their way to courses on learn.wordpress.org, and then during the Q&amp;A, there was a related question about certifications in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The need for certifications has been a regular topic in our project, and I mentioned that there are two different ongoing discussions at the moment. One of those discussions is happening directly on the make.wordpress.org/training site, so I&#8217;ll share a link in the show notes for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve also been personally chatting on and off with Training team reps and other members of the community about what makes that so hard. In case you have not heard my whole spiel about what makes it difficult, it&#8217;s the logistics and our speed of iteration, and public perception.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:05] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So not exactly a small set of hurdles. I&#8217;ll be doing a more complete post on this in the New Year so that we can get some solid documentation of the state of things and not let it be lost forever in this podcast. But I do know that it is something that we are very interested in as a community and something that, historically, I have really been resistant to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not because I think it&#8217;s a bad idea, but because as someone who&#8217;s looking out for our operations side of things and our logistics side of things, it is not clear how we&#8217;re gonna get that done. Like I said, in the New Year, keep an eye out for a big, big post that takes a look at the benefits versus the costs and everything that we can do to help make those match each other a bit better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the last thing I wanted to highlight was the WordPress Playground. Okay, so this was the last thing that Matt mentioned, and I want to be sure that it&#8217;s clear what&#8217;s going on with this project because when I first heard about it, I very nearly lept from my chair!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was such a remarkably big deal. Okay, so the WordPress Playground uses technological magic called ‘web assembly.’ I don&#8217;t know what it is, but it&#8217;s magic. And when I say magic, I mean that this tool makes it possible to run WordPress, an instance of WordPress, including a theme and a handful of plug-ins entirely inside your browser as a logged-in admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t need a server. You don&#8217;t need to select a host. You don&#8217;t need to download anything at all. You don&#8217;t need to know what your domain&#8217;s going to be. You simply select the theme you want to test. Add some dummy content and see how all of the posts and pages function as though we&#8217;re a real live WordPress site running on your favorite top-tier host.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then when you close the tab, it&#8217;s gone forever. Poof. Just like that. Now, this is a brand new project. It&#8217;s brand new to us and has a long way to go. So if working on that sounds cool, stop by the Meta Playground channel in the Making WordPress Slack.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:09]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this, in my mind, changes the way that we stage sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could change the way we determine whether a theme or plugin is right for us. And arguably, it can become a stress-free way to introduce new or undecided users to WordPress’s admin area so that they can tell what they&#8217;re getting into. So when I say that this is a mind-blowing thing, and when I say that it is powered by magic, like it is astounding, it is astounding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the applications for our users as a whole, I think, are untapped yet, and potentially even the applications for our learners and future learners of WordPress– equally untapped. I&#8217;m very excited to see what we can do with this project in the future. So stop by the Meta channel. Stop by Meta Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See what&#8217;s going on over there. We would love to have you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are my highlights of the day for State of the Word. Like I said, there are a few things I want to do more of a deep dive on in the text, so keep an eye out on make.wordpress.org/projects for most of those. But right now, let&#8217;s make some time for the small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:17]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I actually have kind of like a big list of big things. But I pretended it was small, so you didn&#8217;t turn off the podcast. So the first thing that I have is that in case you missed State of the Word, if you didn&#8217;t have a Watch Party to go to, or you didn&#8217;t know it was happening and so you didn&#8217;t really tune in at the time, I&#8217;m going to drop in a link of the recording.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s gonna probably start right when everything gets going. And so you shouldn&#8217;t have to scrub through anything. If you end up on one of the recordings that includes like the whole live stream, there is jazz for the first 30 minutes, and just, you know, skip through that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:00] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on my big list of big things is our annual community survey. So Matt mentioned this in State of the Word, and he pointed out that one of the things that makes WordPress and open source in general so effective is that we have a way to communicate with people who are using our software and we make every effort to be responsive to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the annual survey that we send out, it used to be quite big, and we&#8217;ve cut it down to 20 questions. If you want, you can think of it as like a census, so have your type of work and how long you&#8217;ve been working in WordPress, and what you wish to do with WordPress– have all those things be counted so we have a good idea of the type of person who&#8217;s currently using WordPress, and we can account for your needs and wants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, if you want to think of it more as an opportunity to share the things that were especially useful for you in the project this year or especially valuable for you as a contributor, this is also an excellent place to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:01]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a QR code running around on the internet somewhere, but I&#8217;ll also put a link in the show notes. If you do not know where the show notes are, by the way, they are at wordpress.org/news/podcast, and you&#8217;ll be able to get to the survey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing on my big list of big things is that next year we&#8217;re hosting a community summit. So if you&#8217;ve never been to a community summit, Matt mentioned that it is an opportunity for the best and most prolific contributors that we have to show up and discuss the things that are the biggest problems for the WordPress project right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we also want to make sure that we are making space for the voices that we know that we are missing from the community as well as contributors who look like they are probably excellent future stewards of this open source project that we are taking care of together. And so there is a whole website for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:55]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe it&#8217;s communitysummit.wordcamp.org. Right now, there is a form up asking for topics that you want to be able to discuss while we are there, but it&#8217;s taking place, if I recall correctly, on August 22nd and 23rd of 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number four on my big list of big things is that next year is WordPress&#8217;s 20th anniversary. So on May 27th of next year, WordPress will officially be 20 years old. So on our 10th birthday, anniversary rather, and our 15th anniversary, we pulled together some parties all across the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had some images, some logos, and things that were specific to the celebration that we printed into stickers and that folks put on, like, mugs and backpacks and cakes and stuff. So if you want to learn more about that, keep an eye out in the community channel in making WordPress Slack. They will keep you posted on how to one, find any of those logos and designs so that your local community can join in the celebrations.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they will also help you learn how to have any sort of WordPress celebration party that we&#8217;re doing there in May of 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing on my big list of big things, it was mentioned that on the 2023 theme that was shipped with a bunch of style variations and there was this really, I think, excellent illustrative video that <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/richtabor/\">Rich Tabor</a> put together for us that shows that you can switch through style variations on a single theme and have a site that looks totally different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, that feels like that&#8217;s just a thing that should always have been in WordPress, but it is new this year. And so, if you have not yet had a chance to look at the 2023 theme, it is the default theme that shipped with 6.1. And so, if you have it on your website and just haven&#8217;t had a look at it yet, I encourage you to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:00]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a really interesting implementation that makes a single theme potentially look like an infinite number of other themes, and those style variations can be specific to the theme or can just kind of be around and about in the patterns that are also available in Core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give that a look. I think it&#8217;s super worthwhile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your big list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in the New Year.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Santana Inniss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: ClassicPress at a Crossroads, Directors Consider Re-Forking WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=140466\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/classicpress-at-a-crossroads-directors-consider-re-forking-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8012:\"<p>ClassicPress is <a href=\"https://forums.classicpress.net/t/community-poll-the-future-of-classicpress/4446/80\">polling its users</a> to determine the next step for the software. The project is a pared back fork of WordPress based on version 4.9 that uses the TinyMCE classic editor as the default option with no block editor. It&#8217;s run under a non-profit organization called the ClassicPress Initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July 2022, the project <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/classicpress-on-the-rocks-directors-resign-new-leadership-installed\">appeared to be on the rocks</a> when its directors resigned, saying that the community felt they were now hindering the progress of ClassicPress. The organization was struggling to meet its required financial support but has since rallied and is in a more stable place after moving the donation process to <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/classicpress\">Open Collective</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent forum post titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://forums.classicpress.net/t/community-poll-the-future-of-classicpress/4446\">The Future of ClassicPress</a>,&#8221; one of the project&#8217;s directors, Viktor Nagornyy, presented the community with two paths: re-fork ClassicPress using WordPress 6.0, or continue as-is. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Over the past few years, our core team has been working on improving ClassicPress and backporting features from WordPress,&#8221; Nagornyy said. &#8220;As WordPress continued to evolve, ClassicPress got a bit behind in adding new features as the focus became PHP 8+ compatibility.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An exploratory fork of WordPress 6.0 with the block editor removed exists in a GitHub repository called <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-cms/wp-cms\">WP-CMS</a>. It is not finished but could potentially become ClassicPress 2.0. This option has the benefit of helping the project catch up to WordPress and improve compatibility with more recent versions of PHP, and open up more plugins and themes for users that require 5.0+ in order to be compatible. The downside is that it will take months to complete with ClassicPress&#8217; limited number of contributors and ClassicPress 1.x would need to be maintained in terms of security for some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alternative is continuing to maintain the project as it is with no requirement to maintain separate versions. Nagornyy identified the cons of this approach:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Our small core team will continue to focus on PHP compatibility</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Backporting from WP is prioritized, so new ClassicPress features might not happen</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We won’t be able to catch up with WordPress, functions/features will be missing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Plugins/themes compatible with WordPress 5+ would be incompatible with ClassicPress</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The project is now at a crossroads considering the two options, which has forced the community to reexamine the purpose of ClassicPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So the real question is ClassicPress a Pre-Wordpress 5.0 or just WordPress without Gutenberg?&#8221; founding committee member Daniele Scasciafratte said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Considering also that CP is based on a codebase of 5 years ago and the web is moving on, I think that we should move to Re-Fork and find a way to automatize it as much possible and simplify it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ClassicPress core committer Álvaro Franz, who is also the author of the WP-CMS fork based on WP 6.0, <a href=\"https://forums.classicpress.net/t/community-poll-the-future-of-classicpress/4446/46\">said</a> he is unwilling to help with a continuation of the current version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I don’t see the point in working on an outdated version of something that has already been improved by many great developers at WordPress (as stated by <a href=\"https://forums.classicpress.net/u/mte90\">@Mte90</a>, there have in fact been A LOT of improvements),&#8221; Franz said. &#8220;But I can take care of v2, since I already am the author of the mentioned fork, I can help with keeping WP-CMS up with WordPress and then using that as a base for CP v2.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core contributor Joy Reynolds <a href=\"https://forums.classicpress.net/t/community-poll-the-future-of-classicpress/4446/60\">commented</a> on the thread, indicating  that ClassicPress has a grim future ahead if it keeps struggling to backport all the improvements made after 4.9. She contends that continuing on the same path leads to a dead end, given the project&#8217;s small contributor base:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The whole point of backporting from WP is because they have thousands of developers, millions of users testing every combination of version and plugin and host to find problems (plus a testing team), a security team, and a performance team. CP has none of that and it’s kind of silly to not take advantage of their efforts. But the more things we ignore or fall behind on, the harder it is to backport anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many things that continue to evolve, outside of WP, like PHP, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and various bundled tools (like jQuery and TinyMCE and PHPMailer and Simple Pie and Requests…).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CP can’t stand still at 4.9. That’s dead. But if you tried to backport all the PHP8 stuff, you’d find it very difficult because of all the formatting changes they made, plus all the bug fixes, plus all the new features. The new fork bypasses the backport problem by taking it all at once and deleting the block stuff that is unwanted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally think that CP doesn’t have any features of value that WP doesn’t have. It has a bunch of fixes and a few features from WP, but it’s a dead end, especially with the limited roster of people who contribute code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In a contrasting comment, ClassicPress founding committee member Tim Kaye distilled why the poll seems to be so divisive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If all that people want is WordPress without Gutenberg, there’s absolutely no need for ClassicPress at all since there’s already a plugin that provides what you’re looking for,&#8221; Kaye said. &#8220;It’s called <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor-addon/\">Classic Editor</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The idea that the question is whether CP should essentially mirror a stripped-down version of WP or not is therefore entirely misconceived. Those who desire that objective should be using that plugin. It’s really that simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;CP (and the work that goes into it) only makes sense if it’s its own CMS with its own decision-making process and its own features.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former ClassicPress contributor @ozfiddler, who likened working on the project to &#8220;polishing the brass on a rudderless ship,&#8221; <a href=\"https://forums.classicpress.net/t/community-poll-the-future-of-classicpress/4446/65\">suggested</a> ClassicPress identify a destination before choosing between two paths. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But then, that’s the problem with CP &#8211; it never really knew where it was going, beyond &#8216;WP-without-Gutenberg,\'&#8221; @ozfiddler said. &#8220;So, it means you get statements like this listed as a <em>con</em> for one of the options: &#8216;We won’t be able to catch up with WordPress.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When I was contributing to CP I always thought that the ambitions greatly outweighed the available resources. I occasionally suggested a drastic pruning back of the project, but this was always met with widespread disapproval. I still think that if CP is going to survive at all (and I very much doubt it) then you will need to define a narrower subset of users and focus your limited efforts on catering to them.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ClassicPress&#8217; poll and the 80 comments in the discussion offer a glimpse into the frustrating reality of maintaining a fork of a fast-moving, large project like WordPress. So far there are 31 votes and Nagornyy plans to close it within the next few days if it doesn&#8217;t receive any new votes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 02:21:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"Post Status: Annual Survey • WordPress Playground • Plugins/themes Categorization\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=146066\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://poststatus.com/annual-survey-wordpress-playground-plugins-themes-categorization/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16583:\"<h2 id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-december-19-2022\">This Week at WordPress.org (December 19, 2022)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">What are the four freedoms of open source and how do they impact us?

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how to use WordPress as an education platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m very keen to hear from, and hopefully get you or your idea featured on the show. Head over to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Chris Badgett. Chris is behind LifterLMS, which is a learning management system built as a WordPress plugin. He&#8217;s been in the WordPress space since 2008, and has moved his agency away from general website building to concentrate upon e-learning membership sites, course creation and marketing automation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s on the podcast today to talk about how WordPress and e-learning are a good fit. Although there&#8217;s a flourishing SaaS side to e-learning, Chris is convinced that WordPress allows you to make your LMS site exactly what you want. You won&#8217;t be facing the limitations imposed upon you by the platform. And can, if you have the time and skills, modify almost anything to suit your brand and niche.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We begin by talking through how well a WordPress based LMS site can scale. Should your course be a runaway success, you want to be aware of how you&#8217;re going to have to manage the resources that your site will need. There&#8217;s a lot of dynamic content being displayed to your users, and this will affect the tech stack that you&#8217;ll need to deploy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then get into a broad conversation about how online courses have taken off in the last few years. Even before global lockdowns, individuals and businesses were adopting online courses in innovative ways, to educate their customers, staff, and the wider public. Chris&#8217;s data points to the fact that this growth seems set to continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a real understanding now that in many niches, the course curriculum needs to be adapted and amended continually. This is extremely easy to do with an LMS. You create new content, click publish, and notify your users that the new material is there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discuss the reality of actually making a course. Like writing a book, the idea of creating a course is easy to conceive, but hard to execute. There&#8217;s the content, the branding, the marketing, the updates, and much more. Chris has some advice to help you get over the bumps in the road if you&#8217;ve decided that you want to dip your feet into online course creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an interesting podcast and digs into yet another area where WordPress can help people thrive online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading over to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Chris Badgett.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Chris Badgett. Hello Chris.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:16] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> Hey, Nathan. Great to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, thank you for joining me. Chris and I have been in touch with one another over many years, but it was very nice in the WordCamp US, which was recently something that I attended to find Chris there. Very nice to meet you in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:29] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> That was great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Chris is on the podcast today. He&#8217;s going to be talking to us about e-learning or LMSs, all of the different ways that you can do that with a WordPress website. But if you don&#8217;t know Chris, you&#8217;re about to find out why he&#8217;s an expert in this and why he&#8217;s got the chops to be talking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris, would you just spend a moment or two orientating our listeners, giving them an idea of, a, your relationship with WordPress. We&#8217;re on a WordPress podcast after all, but also why you are somebody who is an expert in e-learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:00] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> Absolutely. So I&#8217;ve been at WordPress since 2008. Around that time I started blogging. I was actually living in Alaska. I used to run sled dogs up there, and I started on the side building WordPress sites for myself and then later for clients, and I kind of accidentally started an agency. And fast forward the timeline a little bit, I started blogging about some courses that I was creating because I was trying to create some more passive income for my family, my newborn kids and everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started blogging about how I did that with WordPress, and this is back in 2000 and 11 or so. Over time I built an agency to about 17 people. People started responding to all my, my blogs on building an LMS website, creating online courses with WordPress. A lot of my blogs, nothing ever happened, but I clearly struck a nerve and the market was interested in this information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our agency started focusing on that. Those are the kind of clients we attracted. And ultimately the clients wanted this perfect e-learning membership site, course creation, marketing automation tool that didn&#8217;t exist. So we built that in 2013 and that was the origin of Lifter LMS. Which is one of the leading learning management systems for WordPress. So I&#8217;ve been a course creator. I&#8217;ve been an agency guy, and I&#8217;ve been in this niche for about a decade here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nice. When you initially launched, it sounds like it was held together by sticky tape. You were literally making it up as you went along. This is the first iteration where you were designing it. How did that go? Were you just cobbling together a bunch of disparate plugins and figuring it all out piece by piece?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:42] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> I would say one of my talents as an entrepreneur is team building, and I&#8217;ve had some really talented developers with me from the agency side. And because I was so close to our ideal customer, as a product guy, working from first principles. We took one of our developers, his name was Mark, off of client work, and gave him a spec to build. He built the first version of Lifter LMS in about 60 days from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No cobbling together anything. And then we launched it to the world, for a closed beta period. Opened it for a week. We got 42 customers in that week. We said if we didn&#8217;t get a hundred that we would shut it down and go back to agency work, but I&#8217;m kind of stubborn. So we, uh, we kept going and continued to develop Lifter LMS. I&#8217;m very much as an entrepreneur where the customers kind of pull the product out of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not trying to push product on the market. So I&#8217;m a really good listener. I&#8217;m a big community guy. I&#8217;m also decent at filtering and focusing and weaving my own vision in with what the market wants. So that&#8217;s how Lifter started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. That&#8217;s really interesting. The WordPress space is obviously full of websites, different things you can do with it, e-commerce, LMSs, you name it. The truth is as well that there&#8217;s a really thriving SaaS side to LMSs. So I&#8217;m just curious if you could give us, being that we&#8217;re on a WordPress podcast, if you could give us a bunch of different reasons why WordPress is a really great fit for an LMS. I mean, obviously we&#8217;re not trying to disparage the SaaS products out there. There&#8217;s going to be a whole bunch of reasons, I&#8217;m sure, why WordPress might be top of your list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:22] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> Yeah. And, and this, I&#8217;ll go back to the voice of the customer here. You know, there&#8217;s some great platforms out there, SaaS solutions like Kajabi, Teachable, Thinkific, Podia, there&#8217;s many others. In the early days, a lot of people were putting stuff on course and marketplaces like Udemy. Udemy as an example started enforcing pricing controls where you can only charge up to $50 for your course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That upset a lot of people. The SaaS solutions tend to look pretty cookie cutter. So people that really want to build like a unique brand and design get the longing to go to WordPress where they have unlimited brand and design flexibility. And then it&#8217;s really just a functionality thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my customers who switched from one of the SaaS solutions, described it this way. He said that the SaaS that he was in, they were trying to conform him to it, like as a course creator and entrepreneur. But over here in WordPress he&#8217;s in the driver&#8217;s seat of what his vision is for his online learning platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s not being put in a box. So that&#8217;s kind of the simple way to say it. Brand flexibility and just this whole ownership and control aspect. Because when you build a site like this, you&#8217;re not just building a brochure, you&#8217;re literally building a business asset. So to have more control over that is something that&#8217;s really important to a lot of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I guess the same could be true in just about every sphere of WordPress, where there&#8217;s commercial rivals that are SaaS products. The customizability. The fact that you can make it your own and do whatever you like with it, given the time and development. Yeah, that&#8217;s the perfect answer really, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does WordPress scale well with LMSs? And what I mean by that is if we took a inexpensive hosting package and we dropped WordPress into that, and then we install one of the LMSs. It&#8217;s doing a lot of work. There&#8217;s a whole bunch of different things going on, and we can get into that a little bit later. Needless to say, there&#8217;s lots and lots of things happening. Are there constraints around the hosting and the tech stack that you need behind WordPress? Or does it actually function pretty well even on modest resources?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:25] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> Well, not all plugins are created equal. Something like a WooCommerce, or one of the WordPress LMS plugins are, quote, heavier. They require a lot more resources. We have a lot of dynamic content, We have a lot of user interactions. So as platforms themselves, like a platform plugin, they require a lot of resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, performance is something we focused on and, I think the industry in general has to pay attention to because as your customers become more and more successful and get more and more users, the last thing you want to have happen is for your tool to start malfunctioning or cause the site to slow down or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality is, yeah, you can start with the cheap, low end of the market hosting and you&#8217;re completely fine. When you start getting above like a thousand users, you need to start looking at bigger plans. We actually have a list on our website of the six options that we recommend. But, we have customers that have 50,000. There&#8217;s one person on there, because we have some telemetry data tracking that people opt into, where we collect just non-identifiable information just to see what people are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen people with 800,000 users in just massive sites. At the end of the day, we work to create a performant plugin and we continually focus on performance. We actually work with hosting companies to improve performance together, which is awesome. There&#8217;s some great hosts out there that take a keen interest in that. Because they themselves as hosts are looking to attract high quality customers, which LMS websites can be, when they&#8217;re successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you do get into large concurrent users or you&#8217;re doing something really at scale, you are going to be spending a lot more on hosting. That&#8217;s just part of the game. But if you design your business model correctly for your school or your academy, or your membership site, whatever you call it. If you&#8217;re hosting bill jumps up from $30 a month to a hundred dollars a month, you&#8217;re fine. It&#8217;s just the real estate tax for your online business. And if it, even if it jumps up higher than that, you&#8217;re having a ton of people move through your platform and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s just a cost of doing business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s just move sort of sideways, away from the tech and possibly away from WordPress just for a moment, and talk about the kind of people who may be interested in this. I&#8217;m imagining just like everybody, there&#8217;s a whole bunch of people who, if you like, they have the New Year&#8217;s resolution. want to do a course. I want to launch a course. I&#8217;ve got this area of expertise and I want the world to know about it. The world will be a better place after I&#8217;ve launched my course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I imagine there&#8217;s quite a high attrition rate, where people have that and then they&#8217;re confronted with the reality of what&#8217;s actually involved. And the course doesn&#8217;t get launched. So just give us some broad outlines of the concerns and considerations you would put in front of people just to say, Okay, if you really are serious about this, bear these things in mind, because I imagine there&#8217;s quite a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:25] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> Yeah. I kind of think of us as having two markets. One is the WordPress professional who builds sites for clients and stuff like that. And the other is what I call the expert industry. And there&#8217;s other niches within e-learning besides the expert, which we also have, but, for that person who wants to take their knowledge, skills, and life experience and turn that into a product through an online course. I think this is not a new story, it&#8217;s an old story. I don&#8217;t know if you, Nathan, or anybody out there listening has ever had a vision of writing a book one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:56] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> I have. It&#8217;s that same story. I haven&#8217;t written a book. I don&#8217;t know if you wrote your book Nathan?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Failed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:02] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> It&#8217;s the same thing, and I would argue, it&#8217;s almost a little harder for courses and stuff than a book, because a book is typing and words. With courses, you got to figure out the website. You start working with video and audio and instructional design and curriculum. All the stuff, it&#8217;s a lot. Really if I look across the patterns of the people that make it, there&#8217;s several things to mention here. One of &#8216;them, which I can go into more detail later, but just to drop it now, is you have to have a baseline of competency across five areas, either within yourself or your team, for it to even work at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so this is the fundamental thing. I call it the five hats problem. So you have to wear five hats. One is you actually have to have expertise. Two is you have to be an entrepreneur, which includes starting a business, marketing, all that stuff. You have to be a teacher. The ability to not just know something, but help somebody else learn it. You have to be a community builder, before the sale and then after the sale. And then you have to be a driver of technology and be able to use hardware and software and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just know what you&#8217;re getting into. So that&#8217;s one. Number two. The people that really make it, take consistent forward action even though it&#8217;s imperfect. What stops a lot of people in this industry is imposter syndrome, and the people that make it literally ship the course, even if it&#8217;s not perfect, even if the videos aren&#8217;t perfect, even if they&#8217;re unsure of their self worth or whatever, they ship it. and then they make it better over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing that&#8217;s really important, I&#8217;ll stop at three points because these are kind of the three biggest that I&#8217;m giving you here, is that a lot of people get really focused on the concept of making money online or building an online business or working from home. And these are all good things and I&#8217;m all for all those things. But they&#8217;re very self focussed. The people that really make it out there, kind of have a service mindset that drives their business. They focus on a particular niche, and they make it about impact and serving others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And through all that, they make a lot of money and they build the online business and they work from wherever in the world. But when you flip that script, from a priority standpoint to be like, you know what, I&#8217;m going to focus on this person and help this person be successful. Quick example. One of our customers, Angela Brown, I watched her go from like zero to like 200,000 person YouTube channel teaching house cleaners how to start and grow their businesses. And she&#8217;s hugely successful now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s really famous in that niche. And, basically she just was targeting people that were just starting out trying to run a cleaning company with cleaning supplies in the trunk of their car, and helping them become professionals. And through all that, she&#8217;s made a bunch of money and everything, but she&#8217;s given everything to her industry and she&#8217;s really focused on helping her core customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s a really fascinating story actually. I&#8217;m really taken by that. I do like the, the story of the underdog. That&#8217;s brilliant. So let&#8217;s go back to your five hats, of which I think you mentioned the first three. There&#8217;s a lot in there, isn&#8217;t there? There really is a lot in there. You mentioned expertise, entrepreneurship. The fact that you&#8217;ve got to be a teacher, an educator. Got to build a community. And then you&#8217;ve got to be somebody who&#8217;s presumably on some level, you described it as a driver of tech, but basically a geek.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would you say that if you don&#8217;t satisfy all of those things, you are kind of asking for trouble? I mean, let&#8217;s say for example that I&#8217;m not particularly good at tech. Presumably there are some of these things which you can farm out? You could hire somebody to do the tech for you and so on. But the other ones really do feel like, that&#8217;s got to be a part of your core being, your soul if you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:44] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> It really depends on the person. I kind of think of it as like a personality type matrix. And by the way, I mentioned one of our major customer set is people who build these kind of sites for clients. So a lot of people are not trying to do this all themselves. They partner with a WordPress professional to be the tech person to actually build the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s a common one that, an expert, especially a really established expert who&#8217;s not in a technical field, maybe it&#8217;s a yoga instructor or some kind of cooking thing or parenting thing. We see a lot of people just partnering with a WordPress professional, I&#8217;ll say that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the entrepreneurship piece, I call our ideal customer an education entrepreneur. They&#8217;re both driven by teaching some subject matter, but also being an entrepreneur, which literally is somebody who creates value out of nothing and gets it out into the world by their sheer will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s one thing to be a teacher. It&#8217;s one thing to be an entrepreneur. Not all entrepreneurs want to be teachers. Not all teachers want to be entrepreneurs. But when you have both together, that&#8217;s kind of the core that you can&#8217;t really outsource. You can hire in pieces of the entrepreneurship, I see people hire marketers to help with content, or ads, or taxes and things like that. But at its core, for someone to be successful in this endeavor, there&#8217;s that overlapping of the teacher entrepreneur in one. It&#8217;s kind of a common thread.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so let&#8217;s imagine that I want to do a course. I&#8217;ve got this area of expertise. Let&#8217;s imagine that I&#8217;m a, I don&#8217;t know, fabulous guitarist or something like that. And I want to spread the word, and teach people how to play the guitar successfully and enjoy it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk to me about the process that you would advise somebody like me to go through. In order to get this thing off the ground, because the first thing I&#8217;m going to do is not shoot myself a video of me playing the guitar. That may be quite high on the list, but I&#8217;m imagining there&#8217;s a whole bucket load of other things that need to be done, in terms of market research, and branding, and coming up with the structure of the course and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, just run us through a typical, different in every case I&#8217;m sure, but a typical way of mapping out the journey from just the idea, just saying you&#8217;re going to do it, to finally having all of the bits and pieces so that you are ready to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:05] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> You know, I&#8217;ve seen so much failure or just slow progress on this question here that I&#8217;ve created a system to help people figure this all out. I call it the five day course plan challenge, it&#8217;s on our website. But basically what happens on those five days. My whole point is give me an hour, for five days in a row and then you&#8217;re going to be ready to actually approach this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on day one we get into a lot of the inner game stuff like your purpose and your vision. Getting some of the mindset stuff straight. Day two, we get into designing your ideal customer avatar. So for you, who are we teaching? Are we teaching other guitar teachers? Are we teaching kids? Are we teaching a specialized style of guitar. Nicheing and doing the avatar work is super important. Then there&#8217;s the actual, this is the fundamental thing that the entrepreneur does, which is, the core of what entrepreneurs do is they create an offer, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An iPhone is an offer. A Tesla car is a offer. A WordCamp as an example, there&#8217;s like a promise there. And what a lot of course creators and coaches and things like that do, is they get really focused on their mechanism, which for your example, is a guitar playing. Okay, that&#8217;s a mechanism. But what is the offer? I have a whole thing where I teach about how to develop this, but basically what it boils down to is, I help X person achieve X result through my mechanism. Offer construction is the key, and if you don&#8217;t nail that, everything else will be inefficient or potentially fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have your offer on the next day, I give people, because a lot of experts have no training in how to be a teacher or a coach. So I have some training in instructional design after a decade in this space of like how to think about chunking down your skills and your, what you want to teach, and the result your avatar wants, into an actual framework that has a high likelihood of actually working. So I help people become instructional designers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the last step, that sometimes people overlook, is it&#8217;s not just about content. You want to design some kind of success system. So if you look at like a popular online course that you can buy, that you hear ads for all the time called Masterclass. This is like $15 a month and you can learn comedy from Steve Martin, and all this stuff from all these famous people, but it&#8217;s only $15 a month. The reason why those courses from the best in the world are so cheap is because they lack any kind of support or connection with the creator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you design a success system, and I have a whole system of how to think about that and map it to your personality style and preferences, but it could include things like group coaching, email access, office hours, phone support, live events in person. When you combine that success element, and not think of your product as not just organized content, that&#8217;s when you really create a winning course. So my advice to you, Nathan the guitar teacher, is to go through that pre-work of those five steps I just laid out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I should probably learn to play the guitar first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:19] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> That too. Hey, expertise is one of the five hats. So if you don&#8217;t have it. You know, sometimes people see a business opportunity. Maybe I&#8217;ll teach people how to trade crypto or whatever. But they see the opportunity, but they lack the expertise. But that&#8217;s still possible, by the way. One of my first courses was in organic gardening and permaculture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I had all the hats except for the expert. My wife was skilled at this, but, I actually went out into the world and found some of the best people in the world. I flew to Costa Rica and traveled to a bunch of places, and I was filming these people doing permaculture design workshops in the jungle or in different places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I went and I got an expert, right? And I was taking an industry that was predominantly offline. I was trying to get it online because I could see how many people on YouTube were looking for this information and everything. So, you don&#8217;t have to have the expertise, is what I&#8217;m saying. Nathan, you can go find you a guitar player, you guys partner, and you can make it happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You were talking earlier about writing a book, and how so many people have this thought and it never happens. I&#8217;m sure that there&#8217;s quite a few people who get halfway through a book and then it never gets across the finish line. They&#8217;ve written the first 25,000 words and it&#8217;s all going great, and then for some reason the atrophy sets in and the word processor never comes out again and it just tails off and gets forgotten about. I&#8217;m sure the same is true of courses, you know, people they decide that they&#8217;re going to set up some kind of LMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ve thought through carefully all of the bits and pieces, but at some point the project gets derailed. And I&#8217;m wondering if, as somebody in this space whose job it is, not only to sell an LMS, but obviously to coach people around how to do that. Are there communities of like-minded LMS-ers, if you like, who can help you through this bit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, if you, if you hit a roadblock, if you find yourself getting distracted and you never get it across the finish line. Are there mechanisms in place, communities, online or otherwise of people who can help you, support you, try to get you through the bit that you&#8217;re stuck on?.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:26] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> Yeah, a hundred percent. I have a podcast called LMSCast, and we&#8217;re about 400 episodes deep. And part of the reason I created that podcast is I wanted to interview people, not just about the tech and WordPress, but around all these other challenges that people face around the five hats, and things like instructional design and marketing and community building and all this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s a resource, but there&#8217;s also a lot of great Facebook groups, as an example out there. The whole course creator, entrepreneur thing is definitely a niche. Coaching. Some people kind of use different words around the space. You&#8217;ll hear course creator, I&#8217;m a coach, I have a membership site, I have a paid community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do all those things and kind of mix and match whichever variables you want in your online learning platform. But there&#8217;s definitely communities and content around these types of people. And you can find the ones that resonate with you. What we find here in WordPress, or just in software in general, is that sometimes people buy the tool before they&#8217;re ready, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s one of the reasons why I&#8217;ve made that five day challenge course for people to be more ready for the tool, and not just the tool, but for the business. And there&#8217;s a lot of people out there who teach around course creation. You just have to be careful though, because there is a lot of over promise snake oil stuff about how easy it is and, you know, follow these easy steps and all this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a big commitment. If you&#8217;re going to create a course, it&#8217;s not easy, I&#8217;m just being honest with you. Just like writing a book is not easy. And starting a business, especially if you don&#8217;t already have an online platform or website and e-commerce system and everything. It&#8217;s going to take a little bit of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of people on this journey. The online industry is booming. People becoming entrepreneurs and wanting to be entrepreneurs and want to work remotely and digitally and be digital nomads and all this stuff, it&#8217;s all booming. It is an emerging trend, and you can find others on the same path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it strikes me that it could be quite a lonely journey being a course creator, because if you&#8217;re doing it by yourself, you may struggle to make those connections, so it&#8217;s nice to hear that there are different communities and groups out there which will help you through that. Yeah, that&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of LMSs and all of that, the technology behind it all. I don&#8217;t know how to phrase this question because it brings up Covid, but during the last few years Covid happened. And I&#8217;m guessing, I have no data to back this up, it just is a thought in my head, that online courses became more of a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More people creating them. More people consuming them. And whilst nobody wants to celebrate Covid, it might be interesting to get into that conversation about whether or not that was in fact the case. Did people swell to LMSs and were there more courses being put out and consumed? And also, what&#8217;s the trend since the world has gone a little bit more back to normal? Since we&#8217;ve been able to go back to in-person events? Has it declined or has it kept its growth?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:28] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> There was a huge boom that I could say from our company, in terms of new users, new customers due to Covid. And also just to talk about a little more, there&#8217;s some different flavors to it. Yes, there&#8217;s some people that want a side income or a full-time income from home now, that wanted to become course creators or coaches and they needed an LMS. But we also saw a big influx of trainers, people that would go places and train people at a company, or they would deliver some kind of event thing from the stage, and now they want to package it inside of a LMS in a course format. They literally had to, to keep their businesses going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there was a lot of, there was a lot of both those aspiring entrepreneurs, but also just trainers and events and regular schools. A big, small, traditional alternative, whatever, that we&#8217;re trying to figure this all out. Yeah, it caused a huge boom in the industry, and I guess it&#8217;s been, I don&#8217;t know, has it been almost three years now? Something like that. The initial parabolic rise, if you will, has slowed, but the industry continues to grow, from what I can see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that caused a big spike, but we&#8217;re seeing the industry just continue to grow. And also new, if you look broadly across the online learning SaaS space and the online community SaaS platforms, and the Zoom alternatives and everything, like the whole industry is just continuing to expand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think there&#8217;s something which I can identify in my life at least anyway. Before the last five years, shall we say, I was probably far less willing to enroll in courses just because, I hadn&#8217;t really done it before. It was still a new thing. Much more likely now, personally, to do that because I now see this as a really legitimate thing. People now have the expertise to do it. There&#8217;s platforms like yours which enable them to do it. And it, it is no longer the thing held together by sticky tape. It can be a really professional enterprise, even just a one person enterprise can do it really professionally, given the arrangement of tools that are out there now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now people can download all sorts of clever software, which will enable the video editing process to be slightly more painless, if you know what I mean. And you can download software which enables you to do the marketing side of things and all of this kind of stuff. What I&#8217;m basically trying to say is, I feel that it&#8217;s become part of the landscape now. Online courses is now a thing, and it feels like it&#8217;s a thing that&#8217;s here for good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:02] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> It is, and I&#8217;ll just throw a few more trends kind of on top that are happening. One is the transition from just in case, to just in time education. So what I mean by that is, you know, if we go to college and we get a degree, we learn a lot of stuff just in case we might need it or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m a fan of college. I&#8217;m not bashing college, but just in time education, as our world has become more complex and dynamic, and the rapid changing of things for example, um, if you need to learn how to use a new software tool or, you know, you go to YouTube the tech training at universities and community colleges has a hard time keeping up with just independent, online learning platforms for fast changing and emerging technologies, just as an example. So, just in time education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other trend that&#8217;s happening is called micro learning, and that&#8217;s where it gets really important to chunk down your content so that it&#8217;s as effective and efficient as possible, without wasting time. So, back in the earlier days of the online course industry, it was all about, I&#8217;m speaking to the expert, entrepreneur kind of subject matter expert courses. It was all about how much stuff you could cram in the membership site. Like, okay, we got 200 hours of videos, 500 PDFs, all these bonuses. The trend we have now is people don&#8217;t have time for that. So, it&#8217;s got to be good. It&#8217;s it&#8217;s got to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will be forgiving on production quality to a degree, like video, audio, whatever PDFs you&#8217;re doing, if you&#8217;re doing that. But the best stuff is like, super targeted, super efficient, very clear offer. There&#8217;s just so much opportunity out there in the world. Anytime I see a friction point in anything, that could be a course. And if you&#8217;re going to, if you as an entrepreneur, are going to jump on that friction point, make it as frictionless as possible for the person to achieve the result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I really hadn&#8217;t thought about the just in time piece, and that makes so much sense. Especially when you think about the landscape of the industry that we are in, technology, specifically WordPress. Things are changing all the time. And something that you may have wished to learn last year might now be completely obsolete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There really is no rival than the internet for that. Online based learning can be updated now, this second, and I will immediately receive the fruits of all of those changes. Yeah, that&#8217;s really remarkable. I hadn&#8217;t really made the connection there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:35] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> And just a quick marketing insight on that too, is if you&#8217;re going to do it, this is why doing the avatar work and stuff is so important, because once you get into this, it&#8217;s going to be a long road, and it&#8217;s not always going to be easy. But my best advice is if once you decide who you&#8217;re going to help, and who that avatar is, and what you&#8217;re going to teach, I would build the course business and a YouTube channel in parallel, because, just in time education, a lot of it happens on YouTube, where people go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I of course want to see people helping people for free on YouTube, from my perspective, across all these tens of thousands of course creators is, YouTube is a really strong marketing channel to get people, you on their radar and then them into your marketing funnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> This leads me to another thought, and it wasn&#8217;t necessarily where I wanted to go, but I&#8217;m going to ask this anyway. If I was a course creator and something seismic happened that meant that my course needed to be amended, adapted, maybe something extra needs to be added. What do we do with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it feels almost like a course is a package, it&#8217;s a parcel. It&#8217;s finished. I&#8217;m handing it over, I&#8217;ve put it in the LMS, and there it is. That&#8217;s the thing. But presumably there has to be modifications made. Let&#8217;s say for example something in WordPress suddenly, let&#8217;s say there&#8217;s a virus which goes around and we need to disseminate the news about that quickly. Just a silly example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would need to put that into the course somewhere. What would the advice be about amendments? Do you normally ask people to substitute one video for another in place, or do you say, Look, add extra content? How does that amending on the fly, nature of online learning go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:15] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> Well, there&#8217;s lots of options. It rolls back to the business model. So you can sell a course that has lifetime access, and then in that case you just update the content or add the additional resource. But if you&#8217;re selling a course that has a monthly recurring cost to it, and this is where the success systems come into play too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to add recurring revenue to a course, the lowest friction way for you to do it, is to once a month do a one hour ask me anything office hours, right. Now you have recurring value. It&#8217;s time boxed to just that hour. And you can help people in ways that they decide to stay and you continually get recurring revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we have a model like that, you need another reason to stay on the subscription is to get the updated content when it comes out. And then a third option, there&#8217;s more, but I&#8217;m trying to give you the basics, is, there&#8217;s this concept of cohort based courses. So we&#8217;re doing this one in the spring, this one in the summer. They&#8217;re kind of separate and they just go with that time period. It is all just thinking through the time, the finances, the business model, what you&#8217;re willing to commit to as well in terms of updating content. Like one of our great customers, Sean Heskith from WP101, one of the largest, I think it might be the largest WordPress education site on the internet. He&#8217;s constantly updating his course content when new versions of WordPress come out and stuff. And he is super professional with it. So he is constantly polishing the asset, if you will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I&#8217;ll just throw one more concept out there. Which is that there&#8217;s these two personality types. One, I call the serial course creator. They] just, they create a membership site and they create a course in November, then they launch a new course in December, and a new course in January, and they just keep adding new courses. The old stuff never really gets updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a guy who teaches people how to tie animal balloons. And he makes six figures with his courses. He&#8217;s got, they&#8217;re like child entertainer and magician type people is his avatar. It&#8217;s called Balloon Artist College. It&#8217;s awesome. But he&#8217;s got like 200 courses on there or something like that at this point. But then there&#8217;s the other entrepreneur, kind of like Sean with his WordPress 101 course, that they&#8217;re just continually just updating the course, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the old school, like internet marketer guys that I followed back in the day, his name&#8217;s Jeff Walker. He has a course called Product Launch Formula that I think I first saw in 2007, 2008. He still launches it twice a year or once a year. Same course. He just keeps polishing it every year. But every time he launches it, I believe it&#8217;s a new product. So different ways to tackle that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It occurs to me that so far we&#8217;ve spoken as if the target audience of the course is individuals. So, you&#8217;re trying to sell out there into the market. You&#8217;ve put a website together and you&#8217;re trying to encourage people, individuals to sign up. But, I&#8217;m wondering if there&#8217;s different audiences out there for your courses, or should I say different ways of implementing them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, for example, you might go after an entire business and offer a hundred seats at your course, or maybe you would just be implementing it as something to train your employees. There doesn&#8217;t have to be an audience of people who are willing to pay. An LMS might just be the perfect way of training your employees. So essentially, I&#8217;m just opening up the conversation to alternative uses of LMSs rather than, okay, I have a course, I&#8217;m going to sell it to a bunch of individuals, one at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:53] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> Yeah. At Lifter LMS we have a groups feature where you can do exactly what you described. Where you offer the training into a school or a business and a certain number of seats. And the leader at that place can keep tabs on the analytics and reporting for their students that they invite into the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s absolutely possible. I highly recommend that too. If you can figure that out in your business model, because it can create a serious amount of revenue when you can do deals at scale like that. Doing it for internal training, we do that at Lifter LMS as an example. We have a site that&#8217;s protected from the outside world, where we have all our customer success, marketing, sales, product, operational, like processes and stuff documented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We use our own tool to train our people, as new people come in and so on. I&#8217;ve seen people get really creative with it, and I&#8217;m thinking of a guy who uses it for tutors. The tutor licenses the course, but then the uses that content with their students up on a screen in the classroom and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s all kinds of ways to do it. I saw one guy run like a pay per view sporting event through Lifter LMS. You know, people get really creative. WordPress, what you can put inside the membership site, it&#8217;s up to you. A course creates structured content. Some people will use it like a course to just hold, like a webinar vault, like a library kind of thing. So there&#8217;s lots of different ways to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, and it goes back to what you said right at the beginning about WordPress. Maybe that&#8217;s one of the reasons why a WordPress solution is so desirable, is that you really can take it in whichever way you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have just a couple of final questions, if that&#8217;s all right. It occurs to me that the listenership to this podcast, not everybody is going to be shouting, I want to make a course. But they may be saying, I have a web design business, and it occurs to me that, well maybe maybe selling courses could become a part of my revenue. Is there a niche out there? Is it a successful niche? Does it even exist of web designers implementing LMSs?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:02] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> Absolutely. yeah, I mean, literally half of our customers, the people that buy the tool are freelancers and agencies, right? So it&#8217;s a split market. And then you have the DIY, do it yourself expert, or maybe that expert just buys the tool and then they hire somebody. So, a lot of people in this space are working with a WordPress professional to make it happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve known that for a very long time. So we created this experts program where we, it&#8217;s not like a paid thing, we&#8217;re not trying to monetize it. We just constantly get asked for like, hey, do you know anybody that can help me build this site? Or, who do you recommend? So we built a list of people that have experience with Lifter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It kind of happened to me as an example. Early on, I had this agency, people just needed all this stuff for their, their online learning business. It&#8217;s a great niche to focus on. They&#8217;re great customers. They often have recurring needs. The site build is complex, from a standpoint that it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s just not static pages and it&#8217;s incredibly valuable, which helps with your pricing as an agency owner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these people often need ongoing work or they want to have like a tech person aside the business, in case they ever need anything, or they have a new idea they want to implement, stuff like that. So it&#8217;s a great, it&#8217;s a great niche if you&#8217;re looking to diversify into it. And I&#8217;ll also say that a lot of times, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people who are WordPress professionals, and they implement for a client, and then once they see how it all works, possibly see their client make a bunch of money or whatever, then they&#8217;re like, you know what, I&#8217;m going to, I&#8217;m going to launch a course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, uh, there&#8217;s a lot of that, that goes on when you really fall in. When you fall in love with the niche, it&#8217;s hard not to start releasing some courses yourself. And as a WordPress professional, one of the things I know from my agency days is that sometimes it&#8217;s a little frustrating or slow to train a client on how to use the website. So as part of your handoff, if you create like a course that they can then stop, rewind, play seven times to get it or whatever, and then make that as part of your handoff package. That can actually add a lot of value and save a lot of time on your end just to kind of use that course in that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another counterintuitive way we use courses at Lifter is for marketing. We have several free courses, but particularly this one that teaches, quick start course, that teaches you how to use the 5% of the tool that gives you 80% of the value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that one course, it lets people that are curious about the product, in about 40 minutes, see how it works, see what it does, to see if it&#8217;s a fit for their requirements. While simultaneously acting as an onboarding, at your own pace, at your own time resource. So super effective in that way. So using courses for marketing and customer success is also another counterintuitive way to, to do them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It strikes me that the more that you do this, the less impediments there would be. So, it may be that you launch your guitar course and it&#8217;s not a runaway success, but there are takeaways there. You know, you&#8217;ve learned how to use an LMS. You&#8217;ve learned how to do some video editing. You&#8217;ve made some mistakes in your email campaigns, and all of those things, and the next time around there&#8217;s probably going to be a little bit less friction. So, I guess one of the messages that you would have for people is, if it doesn&#8217;t work first time, if at first you don&#8217;t succeed, try, try again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:29] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> Yeah, just like anything. Learning is what makes us human, right? So when we double down on like a business model or a tool or a business, failure is just feedback. That&#8217;s why that trait we see in our successful community members, whether they&#8217;re a WordPress professional or more of a subject matter expert, is that consistent, imperfect action moving forward with an open mind That&#8217;s the through line through the people that find the best success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If people want to reach out to you, Chris, if they&#8217;ve been inspired by what you&#8217;ve said and they want to just get a little bit more advice, personal advice, maybe one to one or something, are you available? And if so, where&#8217;s the best place to find you, or best places?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:10] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> I am available. I&#8217;m a big community guy. Community building&#8217;s always been important to me. You can easily find me on Twitter @ChrisBadgett. And then also in our Facebook group. It&#8217;s another great place to reach out. So if you just do a search for Lifter LMS, courses, WordPress, you&#8217;ll find our Facebook group, and that&#8217;s a great place to connect as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Chris Badgett, thanks for joining me on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:34] <strong>Chris Badgett:</strong> Thanks for having me, Nathan.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisbadgett\">Chris Badgett</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris is behind <a href=\"https://lifterlms.com/\">LifterLMS</a>, which is a learning management system built as a WordPress plugin. He’s been in the WordPress space since 2008, and has moved his agency away from general website building to concentrating upon e-learning membership sites, course creation and marketing automation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s on the podcast today to talk about how WordPress and e-learning are a good fit. Although there’s a flourishing SaaS side to e-learning, Chris is convinced that WordPress allows you to make your LMS site exactly what you want. You won’t be facing the limitations imposed upon you by the platform, and can, if you have the time and skills, modify almost anything to suit your brand and niche.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We begin by talking through how well a WordPress based LMS site can scale. Should your course be a runaway success, you want to be aware of how you’re going to have to manage the resources that your site will need. There’s a lot of dynamic content being displayed to your users, and this will affect the tech stack that you’ll need to deploy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then get into a broad conversation about how online courses have taken off in the last few years. Even before global lockdowns, individuals and businesses were adopting online courses in innovative ways to educate their customers, staff, and the wider public. Chris’ data points to the fact that this growth seems set to continue. There’s a real understanding now that in many niches, the course curriculum needs to be adapted and amended continually. This is extremely easy to do with an LMS. You create new content, click publish and notify your users that the new material is there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discuss the reality of actually making a course. Like the writing of a book, the idea of creating a course is easy to conceive, but hard to execute. There’s the content, the branding, the marketing, the updates and much more. Chris has some advice to help you get over the bumps in the road if you’ve decided that you want to dip your feet into online course creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an interesting podcast and digs into yet another area where WordPress can help people thrive online.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://lifterlms.com/\">LifterLMS website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/lifterlmsvip\">LifterLMS Facebook Group</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 15:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"HeroPress: Manifesting Our Life – Manifestare la nostra vita\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=4981\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"https://heropress.com/essays/manifesting-our-life/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=manifesting-our-life\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20223:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/122022-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I joined the most dedicated and inspiring community I have ever met: the WordPress community.\" />\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#italian\">Questo saggio è disponibile anche in italiano.</a></p>\n\n\n\nHere is Isotta reading her own story aloud.\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Every morning from Monday to Friday, when I open up my laptop to start my working day, I smile. Every single day. Multiple times per week, I take a moment to acknowledge the gratitude I feel for living my dream life. I&#8217;ve always been an optimistic person, and in the last few years, I&#8217;ve also become very aware of the beauty of my life, but there is a date that pivoted everything. January 17th, 2022, is the day I joined Automattic to become a sponsored full-time contributor to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-let-s-rewind-it-a-little-bit\">Let&#8217;s rewind it a little bit!&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I was born in a middle-class family in Savona, a small city on the North-west coast of Italy. I had a marvelous and carefree childhood in a caring and fun family that gave me more love and support than I could have asked for. Everyone would always encourage me to follow my dreams, and I&#8217;d rarely receive a NO to my requests. Nevertheless, Savona is a small city, and in the 90s, the people who set an example for me pursued careers that had nothing to do with the digital world; there were butchers, warehouse supervisors, and local business secretaries. I remember how cool my mother looked when she spoke English, as no one else in the family could speak any foreign language! I carried this admiration with me when I started wondering about learning languages and being able to travel the world and engage in conversations with people from different places, cultures, and backgrounds. Fortunately, there was the perfect academic path to follow my dream. Studying translation and interpreting at Genoa University. I specialized in Spanish and French, and took a job in Madrid that brought me to live in Spain, France, Morocco. It got to travel to different headquarters far away from home, including India. I learned so much during those years and met good friends who are still in my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, that company&#8217;s values didn&#8217;t align with mine, and brought them to terminate my contract in 2018. This unfair and immoral dismissal is the first of a list of blessings in disguise that happened in my life since then! For the first time, I could decide what my future job would be, instead of passively accepting a position because of the fear of remaining unemployed. I&#8217;ve always loved cooking. Cooking with others was my favorite way to become closer to new people and friends, learn from their culture, and share mine. I hadn&#8217;t really thought that this could be a profession, until my wife encouraged me to explore this possibility to create the workspace that aligns with my values and help me pursue my mission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We founded Eatsperience Madrid to welcome in our home people from different backgrounds and create a community of open-minded and caring people who shared a passion, wanted to learn and share their skills, and were welcoming to each other. Andrea (my wife) and I were living far from our families, so we decided to offer a space to rediscover those family moments where people gather together to cook, eat, and share quality time. What a wonderful period! We hosted dinners, cooking classes, culinary events up to 5 days per week and met people from all around the world. Andrea was still working full-time for a marketing agency, and I would be working for the culinary business countless hours a day. We were so tired, whenever we weren&#8217;t working, we were sleeping. 2020 was going to be the year when Eatsperience finally would start making money, I had been hired to cook at international fairs and to private events, and we had our own events booked for the entire year. Of course, March 2020 put an end to all of it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I immediately switched online and offered virtual cooking classes for individuals, private groups, and remote teams. It was tough to pivot and try to save everything in those uncertain times, while Andrea was dealing with uncertainty at her working place as well. From our career&#8217;s standpoint, it was another blessing well disguised at first.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-meeting-wordpress\">Meeting WordPress</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We had our WordPress website built by a professional in 2019, but now I had to revamp the site entirely according to the new business&#8217; needs. With the help of an online business manager, we understood the new path we wanted Eatsperience to take, and I got closer to WordPress. We built the online shop on WooCommerce, I learned how to update and customize it, and I fell in love with email automation. I didn&#8217;t realize that there was a huge community behind it, though. Now I wonder if, in 2020, online events showed up in the WP dashboard, but I was too absorbed in learning and worrying about my business to see them. I would land in the forums sometimes, but I didn&#8217;t understand the terminology used in questions and answers, so I got scared and decided to not engage with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-turning-point\">The turning point</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>2020 made us realize that life is too short to live out of worryings, focus on our frustrations, and compromise for jobs and people who don&#8217;t make us happy. So, Andrea and I decided we&#8217;d keep pursuing our dream of working remotely. At the beginning of 2021, Andrea enrolled in a learning program to become a frontend web developer while I focused on consolidating my online business. Nevertheless, the universe had another plan for me, but I still didn&#8217;t know! Alongside Eatsperience Madrid, since 2019 I have been managing an online community, and in 2021 I followed the advice of formalizing those skills I gained as a community manager. I studied and got the Facebook community manager certification because.. why not? For me, it&#8217;s always worth it to keep learning and have a &#8220;piece of paper&#8221; to certify your skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the summer of 2021 it was clear that Eatsperience Madrid couldn&#8217;t survive. Sales dropped since 2020, I had invested all my unemployed fund, and Andrea started to suffer of strong panic attacks. She had been working full-time, studying every evening and saturday, and supported me for the past 2 years. I needed to change that situation and be the one to provide for the family instead. I discontinued Eatsperience, it was like dealing with a loss in a certain way, but this was the third blessing in disguise. I wrote down the list of the characteristics that I wanted for my next company and job, and started applying to full-time positions in remote companies. A few days later, I joined the hiring process for a company that looked perfect to me but when I arrived to the last of many steps, I got rejected. Another defeat, another hidden blessing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During those same days, the turning point. A friend sent me the link for a position at an American remote company called Automattic, which I didn&#8217;t know about. They seemed to be looking for someone with my skills to donate to a non-profit project. Their values seemed perfectly aligned with mine, so I applied and got into the hiring process. The more I learned about the company, the open-source world, and the WordPress community, the more I felt I belonged to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, my feeling was right! I found a place where people are heard, valued, and respected. I found teammates who uphold and support me. And I joined the most dedicated and inspiring community I have ever met: the WordPress community. Thanks to all WordPressers around the world, I learn something new every day, and I grow by watching them shape their world to make it a better place for everyone and the generations to come. I feel lucky and thankful for having the privilege to dedicate my entire week to such a meaningful, fun, and inspiring mission! I feel proud to be a WordPress contributor myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-living-the-life-that-we-want\">Living the life that we want</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since I joined the community in January 2022, I&#8217;ve participated in the impact that we have on our ecosystem as individuals and a community. I gained new technical knowledge and new soft skills. I grew as a professional and as a human being. I&#8217;ve supported my wife while she left her company, became a front-end developer, and is looking for her first job in this industry. We can travel and visit our families, and I can work from everywhere. I&#8217;ve never been happier. I&#8217;ve spent many moments manifesting what I truly wanted for my life, and it has always come true, even if it means going through some defeats first.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that my story reaches those who haven&#8217;t yet experienced the power of manifestation, of stating what they want and being truthful to their hopes and values. I believe in abundance and I believe that we attract what we feel. So let&#8217;s open up to our desires, connect with people, do some good, and live our best lives!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"italian\" class=\"kt-adv-heading_39bac8-8e wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Manifestare la nostra vita</h1>\n\n\n\nEcco Isotta che legge ad alta voce la sua storia.\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Ogni mattina, da lunedì a venerdì, quando apro il mio portatile per iniziare la mia giornata lavorativa, sorrido. Ogni giorno. Più volte alla settimana, mi prendo un momento per riconoscere la gratitudine che provo per star vivendo la vita dei miei sogni. Sono sempre stata una persona ottimista e negli ultimi anni sono anche diventata molto consapevole della bellezza della mia vita, ma c&#8217;è una data che ha cambiato tutto. Il 17 gennaio 2022 è il giorno in cui mi sono unita ad Automattic per contribuire full-time alla comunità di WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Facciamo un salto indietro!&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sono nata in una famiglia di classe media a Savona, una piccola città sulla costa nord-occidentale dell&#8217;Italia. Ho avuto un&#8217;infanzia meravigliosa e spensierata in una famiglia dolce e divertente che mi ha dato più amore e sostegno di quanto avrei potuto chiedere. Tutti mi hanno sempre incoraggiata a seguire i miei sogni e raramente ho ricevuto un NO alle mie richieste. Tuttavia, Savona è una piccola città e negli anni &#8217;90 le persone che rappresentavano un esempio per me avevano intrapreso carriere che non avevano nulla a che fare con il mondo digitale: c&#8217;erano macellai, magazzinieri e segretari di aziende locali. Ricordo che mia madre sembrava fighissima quando parlava inglese, nessun altro in famiglia sapeva parlare una lingua straniera! Questo sentimento di ammirazione mi accompagnava quando ho iniziato a desiderare di imparare lingue straniere e di poter viaggiare per il mondo, per poter parlare con persone provenienti da posti, culture e contesti diversi. Fortunatamente, c&#8217;era il percorso accademico perfetto. Studiare traduzione e interpretariato all&#8217;Università di Genova. Mi sono specializzata in spagnolo e francese e ho accettato un lavoro a Madrid che mi ha permesso di vivere in Spagna, Francia e Marocco. Ho avuto modo di viaggiare in diversi uffici, tra cui in India. Ho imparato tanto in quegli anni e ho incontrato buoni amici che sono ancora nella mia vita.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Purtroppo, i valori di quell&#8217;azienda non erano allineati con i miei e nel 2018 sono stata licenziata. Questo licenziamento ingiusto e immorale è il primo di una lista di quelle che chiamo benedizioni mascherate che mi sono capitate da quel momento in poi! Per la prima volta, ho potuto decidere quale sarebbe stato il mio prossimo lavoro, invece di accettare passivamente una posizione per la paura di rimanere disoccupata.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ho sempre amato cucinare. Cucinare con gli altri era il mio modo preferito per avvicinarmi a nuove persone e amici, imparare dalla loro cultura e condividere la mia. Ma non avevo mai pensato che questa potesse essere una professione, finché mia moglie non mi ha incoraggiata a esplorare questa possibilità per creare uno spazio di lavoro che fosse in linea con i miei valori e mi aiutasse a seguire la mia missione.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abbiamo fondato Eatsperience Madrid per accogliere nella nostra casa persone provenienti da contesti diversi e creare una comunità di persone dalla mentalità aperta, e interessate a altri esseri umani, che condividessero una passione, volessero imparare l’un l’altro condividendo le proprie competenze. Io e Andrea (mia moglie) vivevamo lontane dalle nostre famiglie, così abbiamo deciso di ricreare quei momenti familiari in cui ci si riunisce per cucinare, mangiare e condividere del tempo di qualità e offrirli nella nostra casa a chiunque volesse partecipare. È stato un periodo meraviglioso! Organizzavamo cene, corsi di cucina, ed eventi culinari fino a 5 giorni a settimana e conoscevmo persone provenienti da tutto il mondo. Andrea lavorava ancora a tempo pieno per un&#8217;agenzia di marketing e io lavoravo per il nostro business innumerevoli ore al giorno. Eravamo stanchissime: ogni momento in cui non lavoravamo, dormivamo. Il 2020 sarebbe stato l&#8217;anno in cui Eatsperience avrebbe finalmente iniziato a prosperare. Ero stata ingaggiata per cucinare a fiere internazionali ed eventi privati, e avevamo i nostri eventi prenotati per tutto l&#8217;anno. Ovviamente, il mese di marzo del 2020 ha messo fine a tutto ciò.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Siamo passate immediatamente all&#8217;online e ho iniziato ad offrire eventi di cucina virtuali per singoli, gruppi privati e team remoti. È stato duro cambiare tutto e cercare di salvare l’attività in quei tempi incerti, mentre anche Andrea affrontava momenti di incertezza nel suo posto di lavoro. Dal punto di vista della nostra carriera, è stata un&#8217;altra benedizione inizialmente ben mascherata.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>L&#8217;incontro con WordPress</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nel 2019 ci eravamo affidate a un professionista che aveva creato il nostro sito web su WordPress, ma ora dovevo rinnovarlo completamente in base alle esigenze della nuova attività. Con l&#8217;aiuto di una online business manager, abbiamo capito il nuovo percorso che volevamo far intraprendere a Eatsperience e mi sono avvicinata io stessa a WordPress. Abbiamo costruito il negozio online con WooCommerce, ho imparato ad aggiornarlo e personalizzarlo e mi sono appassionata alle automatizzazioni di e-mail. Non avevo però capito che c&#8217;era un&#8217;enorme comunità alle spalle. Ora mi chiedo se, nel 2020, gli eventi online apparissero nella dashboard di WP, ma io fossi troppo occupata ad imparare ad usare quel nuovo strumento, e dalle preoccupazioni per la mia attività, per vederli. A volte entravo nei forum, ma non capivo la terminologia usata nelle domande e nelle risposte, quindi mi spaventavo e decidevo di cercare le soluzioni di cui avevo bisogno altrove.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>La svolta</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Il 2020 ci ha fatto capire che la vita è troppo breve per vivere di preoccupazioni, per pensare solo alle nostre frustrazioni e scendere a compromessi per lavori e persone che non ci rendono felici. Così, Andrea e io abbiamo deciso di continuare a inseguire il nostro sogno di lavorare da casa. All&#8217;inizio del 2021, Andrea si è iscritta a un corso per diventare uno frontend developer, mentre io mi concentravo sul consolidare la mia attività online. Tuttavia, l&#8217;universo aveva degli altri piani per me, ma non lo sapevo ancora! Oltre a Eatsperience Madrid, dal 2019 mi occupo di una comunità online e nel 2021 ho seguito un ottimo consiglio di un’amica e ho formalizzato le competenze acquisite come community manager. Ho studiato duro e passato l’esame per ottenere la certificazione di Facebook community manager perché&#8230; perché no? Per me vale sempre la pena continuare a imparare e avere un &#8220;pezzo di carta&#8221; che certifichi le mie competenze non nuoce mai.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poi, nell&#8217;estate del 2021 era diventato chiaro che Eatsperience Madrid non poteva sopravvivere. Le vendite erano calate dal 2020, io avevo investito tutto il mio fondo di disoccupazione e Andrea aveva iniziato a soffrire di forti attacchi di panico. Lavorava a tempo pieno, studiava tutte le sere e i sabati, e mi aveva sostenuta negli ultimi due anni. Dovevo cambiare la situazione e prendermi cura io della famiglia. Così ho chiuso Eatsperience, ed è stato un po’ come affrontare un lutto, ma questa era la terza benedizione arrivata sotto mentite spoglie.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ho fatto un elenco delle caratteristiche che volevo per la mia prossima azienda e il mio prossimo lavoro e ho iniziato a fare domanda per posizioni a tempo pieno in aziende che lavorano in remoto. Pochi giorni dopo, ho iniziato un processo di selezione per un&#8217;azienda che sembrava perfetta, ma quando sono arrivata all&#8217;ultima delle tante fasi, sono stata respinta. Un&#8217;altra sconfitta, un&#8217;altra benedizione nascosta.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In quegli stessi giorni, la svolta. Un’amica mi aveva inviato il link di una posizione presso un&#8217;azienda americana chiamata Automattic, che lavorava in remoto e che io non conoscevo. Sembrava che stessero cercando qualcuno con le mie competenze da donare a un progetto senza scopo di lucro. I loro valori sembravano perfettamente in linea con i miei, così mi sono candidata e ho iniziato il processo di selezione. Più cose conoscevo dell&#8217;azienda, del mondo open-source e della comunità di WordPress, più sentivo di aver trovato la mia realtà.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quella sensazione era giusta! Ho trovato un posto in cui le persone sono ascoltate e rispettate. Ho trovato colleghe e colleghi che mi apprezzano e mi appoggiano. E sono entrata a far parte della comunità più potente e motivatrice che abbia mai conosciuto: la comunità di WordPress. Grazie a tutti e tutte le WordPressers del mondo, ogni giorno imparo qualcosa di nuovo e cresco osservandoli mentre plasmano le loro città per renderle un posto migliore per noi e per le generazioni a venire. Mi sento fortunata e grata di avere il privilegio di dedicare il mio tempo a una missione così importante, divertente e stimolante! Sono orgogliosa di contribuire al progetto open source, e di far parte della comunità di WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vivere la vita che vogliamo</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Da quando sono entrata a far parte della community a gennaio 2022, ho partecipato all&#8217;impatto che abbiamo sul nostro ecosistema come individui e come comunità. Ho acquisito nuove conoscenze tecniche e nuovi soft skills. Sono cresciuta come professionista e come essere umano. Ho sostenuto mia moglie mentre lasciava la sua azienda, diventava una frontend developer e adesso mentre cerca il suo primo lavoro in questo settore. Possiamo viaggiare e visitare le nostre famiglie, e io posso lavorare da qualsiasi luogo. Non sono mai stata così felice. Ho passato molti momenti a manifestare ciò che volevo veramente per la mia vita, e si è sempre avverato, anche se questo ha comportato alcune sconfitte lungo la strada.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spero che la mia storia raggiunga persone che non hanno ancora sperimentato il potere della manifestazione, dell&#8217;affermare ciò che si vuole e dell&#8217;essere sinceri con le proprie speranze e i propri valori. Credo nell&#8217;abbondanza e credo che attiriamo ciò che sentiamo. Quindi apriamoci ai nostri desideri, entriamo in contatto con altre persone, facciamo del bene e viviamo la nostra vita migliore!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/manifesting-our-life/\">Manifesting Our Life &#8211; Manifestare la nostra vita</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 07:00:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Isotta Peira\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: Block Protocol Announces New WordPress Plugin Coming in 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=140462\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/block-protocol-announces-new-wordpress-plugin-coming-in-2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6532:\"<p><a href=\"https://blockprotocol.org/\">Block Protocol</a>, a project that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-protocol-project-aims-to-create-universal-block-system-may-collaborate-with-gutenberg\">launched earlier this year</a> that aims to build a universal block system, has <a href=\"https://blockprotocol.org/wordpress\">announced a new WordPress plugin</a> coming in early 2023. It will allow users to embed interactive blocks that are compatible with Gutenberg. Given WordPress&#8217; footprint on the web (43% by W3Tech&#8217;s estimate), this plugin is a major milestone on the project&#8217;s roadmap for supporting a more interoperable and open web with blocks that can be shared through a standardized protocol. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Protocol plugin will give users access to the <a href=\"https://blockprotocol.org/hub\">global registry of interoperable blocks</a>. These include interactive blocks for drawing, a GitHub pull request overview, a timer, calculation, and more. Once installed, users will see these blocks available in the inserter. The newest versions of the blocks are always available to users without having to update the plugin. Creators of the Block Protocol are also releasing a few new blocks alongside the plugin, including an OpenAI DALL-E-powered image generation block and a GPT-powered block for generating text.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>This announcement comes just days after Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2022-matt-mullenweg-highlights-gutenbergs-progress-announces-new-community-tools\">2022 State of the Word</a> address, where he was asked about Gutenberg potentially collaborating with the Block Protocol project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Sometimes developers don’t like to work together on the same thing,&#8221; Mullenweg said in response to the question. &#8220;And so it’s part of why there’s like 200 CMS&#8217;s and stuff like that. Sometimes there might be a stylistic or a technical change that when you look at it, you say, &#8216;I can’t use this thing that exists. I’m going to start something that’s different.&#8217; And I think that’s a little bit what’s happening with Gutenberg and the Block Protocol.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg confirmed that the projects have been communicating but were not able to get onto the same page. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They feel like there’s some things, either choices in Gutenberg or ways we develop things, that just are incompatible with how they see it happening,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We’ll see where that goes in the future. We’ve tried to make it CMS-agnostic so it can be embedded in anything and re-skinned, like you saw with the Tumblr example, it can be totally different. Everything we’re doing is open, so I would hope that wherever they end up, Gutenberg blocks could maybe be embedded, if there’s a translation layer or something like that.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg sounded optimistic about the possibility of interoperability between Gutenberg and Block Protocol&#8217;s specification where users could copy and paste blocks across applications. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Maybe they create something really cool, that’s open source,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And then we’re like, &#8216;oh, let’s bring that over to Gutenberg,&#8217; so the innovation can flow both ways, and sometimes that’s only possible if you’re starting something from scratch.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the Block Protocol project is open source and designed to be an open protocol, Mullenweg said he considers it &#8220;like a cousin project,&#8221; and hopes that WordPress can integrate more in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If not, that’s okay too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Maybe this will just be an alternative ecosystem that can experiment with new ideas or maybe things we would say no to, they can try. And then we see how it’s adopted by users.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial draft of the Block Protocol spec is being incubated by the team at <a href=\"https://hash.ai/blog/announcing-the-block-protocol\">HASH</a>, an open source data, modeling, and simulation platform. HASH is using the protocol in beta. The current version of the spec will be deprecated as of v0.3, which is anticipated to arrive in February 2023 alongside the WordPress plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I obviously can’t speak to what Automattic are officially thinking about the Block Protocol, but we&#8217;ve been energized by the community&#8217;s continued interest,&#8221; HASH CEO David Wilkinson said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Thanks to WordPress&#8217; open architecture we can prove out the Block Protocol first as a plugin, giving users today the ability to access Block Protocol blocks within WordPress, and build blocks themselves that work not only in WordPress, but in <a href=\"https://hash.ai/\">HASH</a> and other Block Protocol embedders, as well. In time we think that the value in having a standard way to write blocks which work across apps will become self-evident.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilkinson said WordPress was the most requested CMS from Block Protocol users, as it is the most widely used, but he also has a personal connection with the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WordPress is near and dear to my heart,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I built my first websites with it, have worked with it for more than half my life (!), and have a huge amount of respect for the organization and operation behind it. It&#8217;s the obvious platform to start with.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Protocol team has received requests for support from users of more than 50 block-based applications, and the project is currently <a href=\"http://blockprotocol.org/wordpress\">running a poll</a> to help identify the next one on the roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the Block Protocol and Gutenberg projects did not find an acceptable way to combine efforts, WordPress users will get the best of both worlds with the new upcoming plugin. At the moment, access to Block Protocol&#8217;s Hub of blocks doesn&#8217;t offer any functionality that is superior to what is found in core WordPress and other native block plugins. The addition of the OpenAI-powered blocks will help make it more compelling, and the protocol&#8217;s ability to work across apps may bring an influx of more interesting blocks in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Protocol is currently onboarding beta testers for the new WordPress plugin.

Newsletters, which were already booming as a communication tool in recent years, have become more critical than ever, as the uncertainty around Twitter has people scrambling to find reliable ways to stay connected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com (and Jetpack users) have had the ability to send published posts to email subscribers for years. This isn&#8217;t usually marketed as a newsletter (as you can see below) but functions in the same way.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.com/setup/newsletter/intro\">WordPress.com Newsletter</a> is a new streamlined product for scheduling and publishing newsletters using WordPress. It uses the same underlying infrastructure as subscribing to sites via email, offering users unlimited email subscribers. During setup, newsletter creators can import up to 100 subscribers from other newsletter services by uploading a CSV file. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>A theme designed for newsletters is put in place with additional <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2022/11/18/new-patterns-subscriptions-link-in-bio-wireframes-and-more/\">newsletter-focused block patterns</a> for the Subscribe box. Users can take advantage of the Site Editor to further customize the site&#8217;s background, site icon, and accent colors. This type of website showcases the versatility of the block editor, as newsletter creators can quickly design their own unique websites, without editing any code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the activity in the newsletter product space lately, I had to give myself a tour of WordPress.com&#8217;s new product to see how it stacks up to creating campaigns with other dedicated email services. In the first part of the setup process, users will upload a logo, specify a site name and description, and select a color. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The next section displays pricing options with a plain link at the top for the free plan. Paid plans are ad-free and allow users to send unlimited emails. In the future, the premium plan will allow users to monetize their newsletters in various ways, such as selling subscriptions or collecting donations.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>After selecting a plan and free or paid domain name, users have the opportunity to upload up to 100 emails from other newsletter services. I selected the free plan, so that number may be unlimited with the paid plans. The site setup is fairly quick, as it puts the default theme in place, and users are encouraged to start writing. It&#8217;s a simple flow entirely geared towards publishing newsletters. Depending on the readiness of the post, newsletter authors can have their first issue landing in subscribers&#8217; inboxes in minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The default newsletter site theme doesn&#8217;t come with additional style variations but users can easily edit the templates to expand, reduce, or further customize what is shown on the frontend. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The default theme is very minimalist but looks nice out of the box on both desktop and mobile. The subscribe form is front and center and recent posts, or newsletter &#8220;issues,&#8221; show up underneath with a featured image.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you are familiar with WordPress, using the block editor is likely far easier than any newsletter campaign editor out there, as these tend to be clunky and limited in options. Publishing directly from WordPress.com also eliminates the need to copy the content over into a newsletter service and reformat it for email, a problem that services like <a href=\"https://newsletterglue.com/\">Newsletter Glue</a> have set out to solve for self-hosted WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>if you are a subscriber of <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/principles#:~:text=%F0%9F%97%BD%20The%20IndieWeb%20Community%20is,platform%20agnostic%20platforms%2C%20plurality%20over\">IndieWeb principles</a>, one of the most important considerations in launching a newsletter is that you own your own data and have the opportunity to practice POSSE (Publish (on your) Own Site, <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Category:syndication\">Syndicate</a> Elsewhere). WordPress.com&#8217;s new offering makes it effortless to follow this workflow for newsletter publishing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One bonus feature, which is lacking with major newsletter service providers, is that subscribers can reply to the email to leave a comment on the published post, furthering the public conversation around each issue of the newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although WordPress.com has experience sending millions of emails at scale, the newsletter product&#8217;s pricing and sales copy doesn&#8217;t mention anything about deliverability rates. This is a major selling point for people coming from other services which haven&#8217;t performed as well on deliverability. There is also no comparison chart showing the limitations of the free account, which may be an important consideration for those who are just testing the waters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are not hosting their sites at WordPress.com, there are a myriad of diverse plugins for self-hosted WordPress that can make newsletter publishing a seamless process.

Please let me know pauli@gutenbergtimes.com or use the comments. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, it&#8217;s the little things, like drag &amp; drop (🐉 + 💧) an image from a screenshot right into the post or the [[ -shortcut to link to other posts and pages on the same site or the gallery block that now has individual image blocks, or the nicely revamped color-picker to assign colors. I am excited about the next WordPress version, to see great enhancements of the Site Editor. It will feel much more natural to use and easier for a user to orient oneself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This last edition of the year has a lot of interesting content for all WordPress users, developers, site builders and designers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wishing you and yours Happy Holidays, and a happy, healthy and prosperous New Year!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours, 💕<br /><em>Birgit</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>PS: With all the talk about collaborative editing, I just came across a great article by the CKEditor team.

With the assistance of two plugins one for Figma and one for WordPress, they showed how you can import your design system from Figma into the theme.json of a WordPress theme. The two plugins are <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/Figma-Tokens\">Figma Tokens plugin</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/vip-design-system-bridge\">Design System Bridge</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a new two-part series, Geatches and Krishan build on that foundation by showing you how you can use imported design tokens from theme.json in the block editor.

The module offers Drupal users a better authoring experience using blocks, allowing them to quickly build landing pages and save reusable blocks inside the editor without any code required. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are more than 3,300 active Drupal installations using Gutenberg, and the module has been receiving regular updates for more than four years. It ships with 60+ blocks as well as access to the <a href=\"https://gutenbergcloud.org/\">Gutenberg Cloud</a>, a cross-platform community library for custom Gutenberg blocks. Since the blocks are JavaScript-only, they work across both Drupal and WordPress sites alike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Installing Gutenberg slashed our content creation time by 80%,&#8221; a content creator at <a href=\"https://www.fortum.com/\">Fortum</a>, a Finnish state-owned energy company, reported to the Drupal Gutenberg maintainers. &#8220;We are able to create more content in a shorter time, allowing us to be much more agile than we used to.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 2.6 includes the following fixes and enhancements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Handle translations for mapped fields&nbsp;<s><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/gutenberg/issues/3320395\">#3320395: Handle translations for mapped fields</a></s></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Support for field groups&nbsp;<s><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/gutenberg/issues/3096002\">#3096002: Support Field Groups</a></s></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fixes for Claro&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/gutenberg/issues/3142400\">#3142400: Compatibility with Claro/Gin theme</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Drupal Gutenberg has removed support for Drupal 8 in this release. Version 2.6 is fully compatible with Drupal 10, released yesterday. Drupal 10 was previously scheduled for June 2022 but pushed back to December. This release shipped with all the new features of <a href=\"https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/\">CKEditor 5</a>, which boasts a more modular architecture, but it is a complete rewrite of the previous version with no backwards compatibility. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>CKEditor is the most popular editor among Drupal users and is now the default editor. Drupal users can easily swap out their editor on per content-type basis, and the Gutenberg module can be enabled as an alternative to CKEditor. The module is superior to CKEditor when it comes to design controls and building layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The maintainers of Drupal Gutenberg hold periodic contributor meetings on a bi-weekly basis, every second Friday at 15-16 CET on <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/afp-yive-gio?authuser=0\">Google Meet</a>. They have fully embraced the vision of Gutenberg as a platform where blocks can be used to edit content and design across a variety of applications.

A small group of people gathered live in New York City to participate while the majority of enthusiasts watched via the livestream. Mullenweg spent an hour reviewing and celebrating the work done across the project in 2022 before taking questions from the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At last year’s SOTW, Mullenweg spoke about how Gutenberg adoption is growing beyond WordPress and how he believed it could become &#8220;bigger than WordPress itself.&#8221; In addition to Gutenberg <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-block-editor-is-coming-to-wordpress-support-forums\">getting rolled out on the bbPress support forums</a> this week to modernize the WordPress support experience, the block editor has found its way into more apps in 2022. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg cited a few examples including <a href=\"https://engineawesome.com/\">Engine Awesome</a> (a Laravel-based SaaS application), the Pew Research Center&#8217;s Political Typology Quiz, the web version of Automattic&#8217;s Day One app, and the Tumblr post form. He noted that in Tumblr, 99% of the editor is hidden &#8211; there&#8217;s no sidebar, everything happens inline. Mullenweg said he is hoping Gutenberg can create an &#8220;open block standard that can be used anywhere,&#8221; where users learn it on one system and it can be applied in other apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who had been missing WordCamps, one of the major highlights of 2022 was the return to in-person events. From 2021 to 2022, the number of meetup groups doubled. Only one WordCamp was held in 2021 but that jumped to 22 WordCamps in 2022. Mullenweg highlighted how WordCamps have historically been &#8220;the magical ingredient&#8221; for onboarding people to contribute and teaching them about WordPress culture. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For being just one year back into in-person events, WordPress has done well in 2022 with 1,399 release contributors and 652 contributing for the first time. There were 204 people who contributed to all releases in 2022 and 424 who contributed in 2021 and returned in 2022. Some 322 contributors took a break in 2021 and returned in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>People are also contributing to Openverse, which has indexed more than 22 million images, 1.1 million audio files, and has handled more than 59 million requests in the last 30 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tools Coming to the Community: New Taxonomies for the Plugin and Theme Directories and Staging &#8220;Playground&#8221; that Runs WordPress in the Browser</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be the State of the Word without a few exciting announcements. Mullenweg unveiled a plan to add new taxonomies for the theme and plugin directories that will help users more quickly ascertain the purpose of the extensions they are considering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, there would be a tag for the type of plugins that a developer might create to solve a problem but may not be intended for wide public use and may not come with dedicated support. Another tag would be designated for &#8220;Community&#8221; plugins, which Mullenweg said is for software that &#8220;belongs to all of us&#8221; with the lead developers stewarding it for the next generation. This tag is for plugins that do not have any upsells and invite contributions. Some of these plugins will be <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-renews-push-for-canonical-plugins\">canonical plugins</a>, those that are officially supported by core developers and receive attention from the security team. Gutenberg and the importer plugins are a few examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another tag would be designated for commercial plugins that have some sort of upsell and often include commercial support. Anything with a pro version will fall within this category. Mullenweg said he wants WordPress.org to create an environment where commercial and non-commercial plugins can exist together harmoniously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new taxonomies will be launching in the directories this month and will also eventually make their way into the plugin and theme screens inside the WordPress admin. This will be a major improvement that will give users of all experience levels a better understanding of the extensions they are examining, making it easier to select the right type for their needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg also announced WordPress&#8217; official support for the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-sandbox-project-demos-test-drive-themes-and-plugins-in-the-browser\">WordPress Sandbox project</a>, which we featured earlier this month. He outlined a plan for what will officially be called &#8220;WordPress Playground.&#8221; The experimental project uses WebAssembly (WASM) to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-prototype-runs-wordpress-in-the-browser-with-no-php-server\">run WordPress in the browser without a PHP server</a>, making it possible to spin up new playgrounds in just a couple of seconds. This will enable things like a guided, interactive WordPress landing experience where developers can edit code live and see the results right away. It will also make it possible for users to try plugins directly from the directory and may someday be used to allow people to contribute to WordPress core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new website for WordPress Playground is located at <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/playground/\">https://developer.wordpress.org/playground/</a> where anyone interested can check out the experimental project for running a WordPress instance entirely in your browser. There&#8217;s also a new #meta-playground Slack channel for those who want to join the conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress turns 20 next year. Mullenweg noted that not many software projects make it that long but WordPress is also growing faster than ever, currently powering 43% of websites according to W3Techs and 32% according to Builtwith. A new website at <a href=\"https://wp20.wordpress.net/\">wp20.wordpress.net</a> will be headquarters for the festivities, including swag, merchandise, and a new Milestones book for the most recent 10 years of WordPress&#8217; history. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t have the chance to catch the State of the Word this afternoon, check out the recording below to hear Mullenweg&#8217;s vision for the next phases of WordPress and see demos of all the progress made on block themes and full-site editing in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 01:42:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"Post Status: The WP Agency Journey with Krissie VandeNoord of North UX — Post Status Draft 134\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=145935\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"https://poststatus.com/the-wp-agency-journey-with-krissie-vandenoord-of-north-ux-post-status-draft-134/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44445:\"<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group eplus-wrapper has-theme-palette-2-color has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/krissierae\">Krissie VandeNoord</a>, founder of <a href=\"https://www.northuxdesign.com/\">North UX</a>, talks with Cory Miller about their work in creating people-first solutions for the nuanced needs of ecommerce and membership site owners.

Their work contributes to the businesses they serve, winning big and experiencing new levels of growth from the unique solutions they bring. From hearing about her background as a natural problem solver to her experiences engaging client needs with creative solutions, you will be inspired to break through limitations into the land of possibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top Takeaways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Building for Nuance: </strong>North UX likes to hone in on what makes a business really unique and find solutions to highlight those things so they are experienced as an asset instead of a detractor.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Problem Solving Spiral:</strong> Poking around, asking questions, and figuring out ways to develop solutions spiraled Krissie from seeing and experiencing challenges to being a solution-building developer. Navigating and figuring things out is the work it takes to give you the experience to increase your confidence threshold. This can act as a springboard to making great connections and solving more complex problems.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Impact of Creating Efficiency: </strong>This isn’t just about creating solutions that get customers to take certain actions. It is also about saving hours or weeks of time spent on manual processes. As a small business owner, I know this makes a BIG difference, and that is exciting. Time can be invested in growth, making the impact exponential. Initial solutions fuel inspiration to shift from survival to ongoing enhancements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Empowering DIY-ers:</strong> Rather than viewing self-build solutions as a threat or an indication of impending obsoletion, Krissie frames this as an opportunity to educate and become a trusted expert who will be there when more complex solutions are needed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.northuxdesign.com/\">North UX</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://geovin.com/\">Geovin</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-you-can-follow-post-status-and-our-guests-on-twitter\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f426.png\" alt=\"🐦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"eplus-wrapper\">\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/krissierae\">Krissie VandeNoord</a> (Team Lead, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/northuxdesign\">North UX</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> (CEO, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemonadecode\">Olivia Bisset</a> (Intern, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper has-background\">The <strong>Post Status Draft</strong> podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4dd.png\" alt=\"📝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Browse our archives</a>, and don’t forget to subscribe via <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simplecast</a>, or <a href=\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P\">RSS</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3a7.png\" alt=\"🎧\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-transcript\">Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> [00:00:00] Hey everybody. Welcome back to Post Tes Draft. Um, this is another great story in our agency journey series. Uh, we&#8217;ll be talking to Chrissy, one of our great agency owners. At post status about her journey today, and I got to a couple weeks ago, get to know Chrissy and more about her story, and I&#8217;m really excited to, uh, be able to share her story with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Chrissy, thanks so much for being on the draft podcast, talking about your journey and what you&#8217;re doing with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> Thank you so much for having me. I&#8217;m super, super excited. Um, yeah, I couldn&#8217;t be, I couldn&#8217;t be more excited to just kind of be engaged in this community and seeing kind of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Communities, specifically around agencies kind of start to develop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> It&#8217;s really exciting. There&#8217;s so many good people, members of post status doing great work, and I love when I get to talk to people like you and just see what cool things you&#8217;re doing in the world. So could you tell us, uh, a little bit about [00:01:00] your agency and where you&#8217;re at now and what you do for your clients in the world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> absolutely. So, um, I own North. And, um, my last name is Van De nor, which actually means from the North and, um, which is where North UX came from. When I started, I knew I didn&#8217;t, I wanted to be more than just me. Um, and so I didn&#8217;t want to just like, use my name. And so that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s how we got to North ux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And ux obviously. That&#8217;s just very much the center of what we try to do is we&#8217;re really trying to deliver, um, a development experience that very much is considerative of um, how real people are going to engage with what we&#8217;re, what we&#8217;re doing and what we&#8217;re creating, and. [00:02:00] Very, very much like a people first kind of</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I love that there&#8217;s real humans that actually have to use the web, so it&#8217;s kinda good to have that experience. I love, I love the, the basis for the name. Um, so what kind of work do you do at your agency? Yeah. Basis,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> we typically, um, find, I would say, you know, right now, 99% of our work is, is WordPress in some regard, most of it is some kind of e-commerce, whether it&#8217;s a membership type e-commerce, or whether it&#8217;s actual like a product WooCommerce, um, setup and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would say that we specialize in, uh, working with clients who need something that doesn&#8217;t exist in an off-the-shelf plugin right now. Um, sometimes that&#8217;s just a, a really custom user flow. Like they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re going to use WooCommerce, but they want to really walk their customers through in [00:03:00] a very set, set way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, sometimes it&#8217;s custom functionality, um, like extending subscriptions or, um, We&#8217;ve done a project with Restrict Content Pro where um, instead of renewing on, um, like a normal annual, like one year from when they signed up, we needed everybody to renew at the exact same time every year. Uh, little things like that that, um, really kind of, I think help businesses and set themselves apart in an industry to be able to just extend kind of like what&#8217;s just out there and accessible to the general business population.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. And so I, I&#8217;m sorry, I was writing a note, but if, if I missed it. So a lot of your work is membership site projects,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> um, either memberships or Woo</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> commerce. Woo commerce. Okay. Yeah. Um, and, and particularly helping with the experiences and some of those custom things that don&#8217;t happen out of the box that I know [00:04:00] from my experience, Christy, and you know, this way better than me building the e-Commerce Pro product back in the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a thousand flavors of e-commerce times infinity because everyone has like you. I was trying to imagine when would somebody want to start the first day or whatever that could be, you know, probably a hundred different things, but like there&#8217;s so much nuance in e-commerce and memberships that why organizations, agencies like yours exist because there&#8217;s so many nuanced needs out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> I mean, it&#8217;s impossible for a plug and developer to be able to truly like be all things to all people and you know, arguably, Trying to do that to a certain extent is going to like water down or bloat, um, what they&#8217;re actually offering. And so we tend to work with plugins that are built in a way and intended to be easily extended by another developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, because what we just found is like businesses, [00:05:00] even though, you know, it&#8217;s interesting cuz I think businesses. There are, there are definitely, they&#8217;re buckets. You can put businesses, you know, you&#8217;re direct to consumer, you&#8217;re selling a physical product, you&#8217;re selling, um, you know, digital content. And, but at the same time, like they&#8217;re so different and so nuanced and they have such unique needs, um, that it&#8217;s just really fun to kind of like hone in on what makes businesses really unique and then like work to highlight that and, and make that be an asset instead of a detractor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, we would always have this example like, okay, you, you sell a t-shirt, but you want a membership with it. And oh, by the way, you want a 14 day trial, or you want them to pay a dollar for a 14 day trial. And, uh, I mean, you know, oh, and then you wanna be able to add consulting time or a coaching thing to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s the day and age we we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re in right now is, The web enabling these businesses with [00:06:00] vast setups to be able to offer those things online where it was picking up the phone call and say, okay, well I&#8217;ll take one of those, one of those, one of those. Well, this is technology doing that. So I love that you all are helping people with that, because I see that need so often with these vastly nuanced, uh, needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> and I feel like that level of nuance was really only available at enter. Like, I mean, even like five, 10 years ago, you know, you, if you were a small business like you, you just had to try to make do, um, because it just wasn&#8217;t as accessible. And there are so many tools now that get you, you know, 70% of the way there, that that extra 30% you can bite that off and it&#8217;s no big deal, um, to a small business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas before it just wasn&#8217;t even. , you know, something they were really considering as a possibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> And that&#8217;s so great, like you said, with the enterprise, [00:07:00] um, you know, with huge budgets, Disney or some other big can code that probably for, to code that. Mainly now we have some tools and great agencies like yours now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So tell me a little bit about your team set up and how you work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> Yeah, so, um, I have. One official employee, um, and she&#8217;s a project manager and she has been, oh my goodness, that was such a, I can&#8217;t believe I waited so long to hire a project manager, . I should have done that a long time ago. Um, and then everyone else currently right now is a contractor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, they are either in Europe or in the us and I find that it works best for us to kind of just work on. Hourly model. That&#8217;s how we structure our projects. Um, we give people estimated ranges and we bill hourly. And so I just do the same for, for my people. Um, and I, I just feel like that, [00:08:00] that for me, I&#8217;ve found has been the best setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried a few other things, but as far as like really like paying people for like the value that they&#8217;re bringing, Really doing a true straight up hourly has been the best, best situation. And so right now we have got, um, A freelance designer and UX person, um, that contributes regularly. And then we&#8217;ve got, um, a front end developer that contributes regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, we have two backend developers beyond just myself. I&#8217;m a full stack develop. I started as a designer and then quickly kind of moved into the development world cause I wanted to control what things looked like and, and now somehow a full stack developer. So, um, And, and just kind of wear all of the hats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, that&#8217;s kind of the makeup of the team at the current moment. And we&#8217;re honestly at the spot now where I&#8217;m I. [00:09:00] Very much looking towards January and having meetings with clients and them saying, we wanna do this, we wanna do that. And I&#8217;m like, okay, I need to figure out who I&#8217;m hiring on , who I&#8217;m gonna bring on</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause we&#8217;re not gonna be able to cover</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> all of this. That&#8217;s a great reflection of doing good work, you know? Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> I&#8217;m a, it&#8217;s a really, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s an exciting place to be, but it&#8217;s also, um, I feel like whenever I bring somebody new on, there&#8217;s this trade off. Um, my productivity decreases because I&#8217;m spending time training them and getting up them up to speed and they&#8217;re not like immediately productive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s this like dip of like, Okay, now we&#8217;re</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> great. . Yes. Yes. Well, um, okay, so that&#8217;s how you work and you started getting in a little bit to your journey. So that&#8217;s where you are now. Um, working with WordPress obviously, but also membership sites, WooCommerce, and how your team kind of set up and how you work with clients.[00:10:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tell us how you got here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> Yeah, so like I said, I started as a designer, um, and. It was just like early two thousands, mid two thousands, somewhere there, , where, you know, blogs were super popular and everybody had a blog and um, and so I. I had a blog, but I was a designer, so I wanted to make the blog look like I wanted it to look like, especially if it&#8217;s like representing like myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I just, it, it happened to be in WordPress and I just got in there and started like poking around and figuring things out. And that was really kind of like my first experience with code was kind of just. Poking things. And, you know, fast forward, you know, a few years I started with a very small agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and so we, we all wore a lot of hats. And when [00:11:00] I started it was, oh, you know, can, you know, doing a lot of design, but it was, oh, can you, you know, tweak this, you know, h t l newsletter or can you tweak this webpage or whatever. And after a few years, I would start to ask them questions and they&#8217;d be like, you know, more than we do about development right now,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and it just kind of spiraled into. Becoming the queen of web, um, and, and grew from there. I&#8217;ve just always been a natural problem solver. And so that idea of, Hmm, can I do this? I wanna find out , like I wanna figure out how I can do that. Um, and so it, yeah, it just kind of spiraled from there. And then, um, I was with that small agency for I think about eight years, and it just was a real obvious, um, You know, they weren&#8217;t bringing in the business to fill my plate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, and so we parted ways, but, and at, at [00:12:00] first they were like, let&#8217;s, you know, keep this relationship going. We&#8217;ll use you as a contractor. But I was like, ah, I just really want a job . Um, I was at that point in time, um, when I started my business, I had a one, I, not even a one year old, he wasn&#8217;t even one years old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>my second kid. and my daughter was three at the time. So like, I had small children and I was just like, I just want something like nice and consistent and reliable. Um, but it, I did end up starting my business and it&#8217;s been fantastic. Um, and I&#8217;ve never looked back. Um, and it&#8217;s been just, uh, like in some regards, my fear of it, lacking the stability I&#8217;m feeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got these young kids, um, Has like the other side of that coin is it&#8217;s offered me the flexibility to like be fully invested in work and at the same time feel like I can be present with my kids and my family. Um, [00:13:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> do good work and also live life, like Right. Live and manage life. Yeah, absolutely. Now what, what year was it when you started North ux?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, 2016. 2016. And then how, how did it evolve to, to get into where you&#8217;re really focusing on a lot of commerce and membership projects? Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> you know, it kind of just happened. Organically. One of my first clients was, um, I took over a project that was WooCommerce, um, from someone else. And that was the first time I think I&#8217;d done anything with WooCommerce that really involved extending it in any way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and so I just like dove right into the deep end. And, um, man, I, I learned a lot about Woo Conversa in that project cuz we were migrating them. From a whole other system and subscriptions. And so it was, it was just a beast of a [00:14:00] process, um, that took way longer than we thought it was going to. But, um, I gained so much from the experience that then it just was a springboard towards doing more and more along those lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also made some really great connections and working on that project, kind of like. Space. Um, and so it just was kind of like a natural extension. And then I think also because I am such a, I just, I really love the problem to solve. Um, I think that e-commerce space just tends to offer the problem a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I naturally gravitate towards like, Ooh, that&#8217;d be fun, .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, you, you have to have that mindset and attitude, I think for that because I think of those subjects, I go, oh my gosh. Every possibility, every possible problem. But you have to be somebody that loves that rub. Rubrics cube, you know,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> kinda problem solving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yeah. Yeah. I used to say, um, and I don&#8217;t think this is true anymore, but especially like when I was still working at that agency now as I transitioned into my own business, that when somebody [00:15:00] would come to me and say like, can this be done? I would do just enough research to feel like 60% confident that the answer was yes,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I&#8217;d be like, yeah, we can do it. And then I would just figure it out. Um, and I&#8217;m also just a very much like a, I will finish it. Like it may take longer than I wanted it to. Um, but I&#8217;m kind of like, I can&#8217;t let it go until like I actually solved the problem. And so I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any, there&#8217;s ever been something where I like was like 60% and then got into it and was like, oh, nope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevermind. Can&#8217;t do it. . Um, and I would say anymore, like I. My confidence threshold is much higher just because from experience. Um, so I&#8217;ve never, I think at that 60% mark, but that&#8217;s definitely where I started</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> that I think that&#8217;s good though. And that&#8217;s the beauty of everything we&#8217;re doing with talented people like yourself is if you have that much confidence, confidence, at least, you know, the other part is part of [00:16:00] just navigating and figuring it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Exactly. Can you, can you share, um, and you don&#8217;t have to say the name, of course. We want to, you know, I know sometimes we, we need to be careful sharing clients and names and stuff. We can, can you talk about a recent project you&#8217;re really proud of, or you really appreciated what you did, uh, with, with some of your clients?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> stick out. Oh my goodness. Like so many of them. So many of them. And I don&#8217;t think I have any, well, I&#8217;ve got one that I&#8217;m currently working on that I can&#8217;t really talk about, but the rest are all out there for anybody to experience. Um, trying to think what&#8217;s the best, like, I think the most recent one, um, that has just like a real kind of feel, good sense to it is, um, and I talked about it in, um, the woosh, um, presentation that I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goodness. When was that? Beginning of October. Um, but it&#8217;s this furniture company, Giovan, and we did [00:17:00] a implementation, well, we, they were on a very static site. Um, they sh they sold through dealers and so they, for a long time just didn&#8217;t have the need for e-commerce because it, you know, dealers are pay, we&#8217;re placing large orders, that sort of a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we essentially moved them into, like, we moved them from like way old to like way new. And to watch them kind, kind of like step into this, um, digital world has been really fun. And, um, we created, you know, a 3D model that connects to the WooCommerce attribute so people can like customize their furniture pieces and like see it like in real time, um, which is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, Like, the part that I&#8217;m loving about it is how much we are like equipping, like the people inside the company and like how it boosts [00:18:00] their excitement about what they&#8217;re doing and then, um, like how that then trickles out to like their customers. And just like having all these like improved experiences and being able to do things so much more efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. We like, create efficiency for a business, like almost more so than, um, you know, when we design a great landing page and the, you know, we look at the analytics and we&#8217;re like, oh, the users are doing exactly what we wanted them to do. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s rewarding, but, I think that I get a little bit more of like a rewarding sense when I&#8217;m like, I just saved you like 20 hours of work every month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that to me, I&#8217;m, I think just because I am a small business owner, I know how big of a difference that makes to a small business that I get really excited about this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Oh yeah. Anytime you can save time like that, I hope they value and understand that like you just took a big swath of our time out, that we can focus [00:19:00] on other things now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And particularly like a furniture company that might, that you know, more traditional sales thing and being able to have that ability now on the web I think is pretty, pretty amazing. Oh</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> yeah. And they do. I mean that&#8217;s, um, I need to figure out how to better quantify those things when I get those calls cuz they&#8217;re harder things to try to quantify is like when you&#8217;re talking about like employees time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we built one system that has um, an integration that tracks like continuing education credits. And this organization put on a conference every year and they&#8217;ve got, their members are tracking their credits score. The way that they were trying to process that. It was literally like manual assignment sheets and then somebody was like data entering, like all of this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And after we transitioned to this new digital system, and it&#8217;s like the conference was over and like all of the credits were entered like in real time as people attended because it happened digitally. He was just like, I don&#8217;t even know what to do with myself. I mean, I would&#8217;ve spent six [00:20:00] weeks trying to process all of these c e credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t have to, like, it&#8217;s done. I don&#8217;t, like it was just mind blowing to him of like, oh my goodness, I don&#8217;t have to do</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> this. I&#8217;ve got experience helping a mental health organization, um, offer CEUs. And, and they do have that same thing, so I need to refer them on to you to do something like that because, um, she was the point of content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their marketing director would spend some, probably half a day on the back end after we did a C E U. Um, To like, you know, get all the paperwork and everything ready to go. Yeah. And</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s always somebody like that. It&#8217;s always like, why is the marketing director having to do this? Because like there isn&#8217;t somebody that is, I, you know, there&#8217;s nobody else to do it and just has to get done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And cuz you know, they do the website and so, you know, whatever, like it somehow falls in their lap. But those are the people that I think appreciate the most when you save them time too. Cuz they&#8217;re like, I didn&#8217;t wanna be doing this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Uh, it seems very much [00:21:00] too is like if you&#8217;re an organization business that is trying to do more of those things online to reach more people and probably secondarily don&#8217;t fully realize it efficiently, um, that&#8217;s how you help people navigate that and then build the result they&#8217;re trying to get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That helps save time and increase the, and grow the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> And honestly, I think that in some regards, when small businesses can see like that kind of a direct value, it&#8217;s easier for them to bite off a more sizable project, like financially speaking, because they&#8217;re like, oh shoot, I don&#8217;t have to hire somebody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s a lot of money that I&#8217;m. Saving, like sure, that&#8217;s not a big deal if I am gonna pay you, you know, 30 or $40,000 to build this, you know, site for us. Um, cuz now I don&#8217;t, I&#8217;m not hiring another person. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> and so it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a big win. We see that all the time at post status with our members trying to hire hiring&#8217;s tough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not even now. It&#8217;s just tough in general because [00:22:00] mm-hmm. , um, there are some tech companies that can throw lots of money at someone. You, the person wants to stay engaged with interesting projects, and I think that&#8217;s where our agencies like yourself, um, really have a great solution in that. Why hire a full-time person?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might not have the training excu, uh, skills experience that you all have access to and, and have, um, to do that. Where I, I hear a lot of our agencies, you know, they&#8217;re the support, summer support for just, you know, basic website updates, but then someone like you all just to, you know, manage, I know from my own, our own business projects, You know, when I, when we add in an e-commerce option, I&#8217;m like, who&#8217;s gonna babysit it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who&#8217;s gonna be there when we need to do something more than the base software might do for us? Cuz we have those new odds setups and things like that. And then having someone like North UX where you can rely on them without having this, there&#8217;s so much overhead. Like we talked just a minute ago of hire having [00:23:00] a full-time employee, but someone who knows WordPress and web stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s even a higher bar, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> Oh yeah. Oh. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> do you do ongoing, um, support retainers, things like that? Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> Yes, we do. And what I, what&#8217;s interesting is I was, I was just actually just sharing the story the other day that about a client, um, that like when they came to us, and this is, this is the same client with the, uh, CU credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like when they came to us, um, they had it, they had a WordPress site, but Oh my word. It was so outdated and it was, There was, there was p h P in the content editor. Like, I mean, it was just like, and I&#8217;m like, I dunno what, like it&#8217;s, it was so like, Not great. And so it was very much like, and, and they were very kind of like, oh, trepidatious about, you know, spending money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so like, we started them on this like super small monthly plan where we&#8217;re [00:24:00] literally just like, we&#8217;re just gonna duct tape things to kind of like keep this thing going. And then I, you know, gave them proposal for a new site. Really like pared it down to try to get it to this point where it, it was a digestible cost for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and so it was like a really limited scope. Um, and like, you know, that first plan they were on, I think was like $500 a month or something like that. And, um, now they&#8217;ve turned into clients and like once we launched their site, they&#8217;re like, we can automate that. And they, I mean, we probably. On a given month, do 30 to 50 hours worth of work for them because there&#8217;s just something else that they&#8217;re like, Ooh, let&#8217;s make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New and shiny. Let&#8217;s make that new and shiny. Let&#8217;s do this. And you know, and they have really bought into like the value of what we&#8217;re doing for them. And so it&#8217;s not even so much like, uh, a support plan or a retainer from [00:25:00] just like a, keeping the site going. It&#8217;s very much like an ongoing enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we find that a lot of our clients kind of, once we do like the first big project, they. Start to kind of move into this, like, oh, we just want to continue to iterate and add more features and functions and, um, and just make it bigger and better and, and whatnot. So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s even beyond just the support of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Be that backstop, be that partner ally when let them do what they do best and you all do what you do best and that seems to work fantastically. Um, okay. So, you know, with all of your experience with, with e-commerce, Myriad of versions of this. I&#8217;d love to get your thoughts on where it&#8217;s going, what trends and things and themes you see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, during C O D. Um, I was just talking to an agency owner yesterday that, you know, they were working with, let&#8217;s say yoga studio studio business owners, and [00:26:00] their, their business and business model got flipped on its head. So then they transitioned to use web, which I think is such a, if there&#8217;s positives that come outta Covid, I would mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>or, or the pandemic. I would say it&#8217;s this. Did you know the whole world exists out here for your. From an e-commerce and all these type of things, perspective, what are you seeing? What are you looking forward to, you know, out there as, as you know, particularly as you work daily with clients doing these, these cool projects for them to grow their businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What, what things are you seeing that stand out to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> Um, yeah, so I think that there are a lot of people that are kind of like jumping into. Um, online business kind of a thing like for the first time. Um, and at the same time, like as so many companies have kind of come out with these, and even as work processes moved more towards like a, a, um, an actual usable like [00:27:00] page builder, like d i y kind of a website thing, um, I think that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I think you could either look at that from, a couple of, you can look at it like, oh, it&#8217;s almost like, well, we&#8217;re just not needed anymore. People can just do it themselves. Um, but the reality is like, that&#8217;s not true. But I think that the way that we are, um, engaging with the people that do want to do it themselves, um, I think there&#8217;s opportunity there and I&#8217;m kind of excited about some of the things cause I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As nor as an agency, we&#8217;ve really served these very, um, like small businesses, but very established small businesses. Like they&#8217;ve been around for a while. They have, you know, 10 to 20 employees. Um, you know, they&#8217;ve got money to invest in a sizable project. Um, But I&#8217;ve kind of always wanted to figure out, um, a better way to catch people, like catch businesses as they&#8217;re [00:28:00] just starting because of what I&#8217;ve, I mean, so many of our clients made poor tech decisions in the beginning and are with us because we are unraveling something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so how can, how can with this new. Uh, you know, it&#8217;s so easy to do, like no code or page builders or whatever, like how can I walk people through, like just when they&#8217;re just starting to give them resources so they understand the decisions that they&#8217;re making and are when they&#8217;re comparing apples to apples or apples to oranges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cuz sometimes they don&#8217;t even know. And, um, they&#8217;ve got a cucumber and they had no idea, um, , but it&#8217;s technically a fruit. So, Um, but like give them the resources and the knowledge about technology in a way that they feel empowered to make some decisions and like also establish ourselves as, um, as experts in this area so that [00:29:00] then when they get to the point where they need the one little extra piece, like were there to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and so I think that there is definitely almost like that, um, moving towards like a. Partner with you around some of the stuff you can do for yourself, um, as opposed to just, we&#8217;re gonna do it all for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, I can see that. You know, we, we, we have a great friend who we helped start, get her off the ground and she was doing a physical product and, um, it was interesting trying to look at all the options out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know a little bit more than most people, uh, when it comes to these. But what we found too was like there&#8217;s a graduation point you may start selling here and it helps fill a need, but then you get into more complex, and if you&#8217;re like me, I go, I don&#8217;t do this all day, every day. I wanna find somebody, an expert to lead and guide me through these things.[00:30:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve talked to a lot of our agency members like yourself and go, there&#8217;s this shift from, it&#8217;s not just Technic delivery. That&#8217;s part of it for sure. But there&#8217;s also this thing, I hope clients are more and more valuing that having a guide like yourself who has been there, done that do, does this every day to help you not make those big pitfalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when there&#8217;s those steps, it seems like there might be a. , you know? Mm-hmm. , maybe we get on this thing, it&#8217;s the software as a service software solution, and it gets &#8217;em to a step, but then they&#8217;re like, we&#8217;re ready to graduate. We wanna do all these things. Then they can come to North UX and say, guide me, lead me, and deliver the project too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Are, are you seeing that more and more to, it seems like that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re saying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> Yeah, exactly. And I think what I&#8217;m, what I&#8217;ve seen is I feel like, um, I&#8217;ve encountered so many businesses that kind of, you know, they did the steps and then they got to a point where they were like, we wanna take the next step, but we can&#8217;t figure out how to do it from where we&#8217;re at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And [00:31:00] by the time that they&#8217;re actually starting to engage with someone who knows this space, it&#8217;s like, oh, well we actually need to go all the way back. Square one because you have reached the top of where these stairs were going. Yeah. Um, and so helping them to make the decisions along the way that are really paving the way for their future, even before they really know what their future holds, um, I think is just, it&#8217;s huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Oh yeah. And there&#8217;s so much complexity there and, and I say that&#8217;s a byproduct of success. You&#8217;ve gotten to this point that you need to come to Christy and other, other, our agency owners and help you guide them because you&#8217;ve gotten to this complexity and hopefully that&#8217;s called success. Well, you&#8217;re ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You need, you need this. You&#8217;re ready to take this new step and blow your business out the doors for the next stage. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> And we also, like, we&#8217;ve even. Taken clients through to where they&#8217;re, they&#8217;ve now they&#8217;ve grown enough that they&#8217;ve hired an in-house developer and like we&#8217;ve partnered with them to help them figure out like, how do we hire, should [00:32:00] we hire an in-house developer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and how do we hire and then continue to have a collaborative relationship to like supplement. , you know, their developer and like also just helping business understand like, you know, it&#8217;s unrealistic to think that you&#8217;re gonna hire one person that&#8217;s going to be able to truly do everything. Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, and so helping them understand like what is the range of skills and where&#8217;s like the 80% mark in a role that you could carve out? And where is this 20% like? Somebody that actually could do the 20% and then you&#8217;re still stuck with , the 80% that they&#8217;re not skilled for having to outsource, um, those kinds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of things of like really just walking everybody through from the point of like DIYing your first website to your big enough business that you have an in-house developer and we&#8217;ve held your hands the whole way</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> through . It seems like that&#8217;s a trend in a lot of business, not just in the technical side, but where you might have somebody, that person, and I&#8217;m not [00:33:00] trying to devalue that person, but is a coordinator of these things that works with great groups and partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t wanna say vendors, but partner. Yeah, that can come in and do those, and they&#8217;re air traffic control. I need to get these things done. We talk about a lot with the marketing side of things, Matt. You might have some that coordinates all these other things, but if you, like you said, if you expect that person to do everything, you&#8217;re wishing for a unicorn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, Christy, this has been awesome. I want to ask finally, um, what you&#8217;re excited. Coming up next year or so, um, with your work and your agency work in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> Yeah. Um, oh my goodness. I&#8217;m like, what, what do I pick? . Yeah. Right. I&#8217;m excited about a lot. Um, I think the thing that I&#8217;m most excited, and I&#8217;ve not said this like out loud publicly yet, I don&#8217;t think, um, but kind of along these lines of [00:34:00] this, like to helping people start at the beginning is, um, I&#8217;m getting ready to kind of launch like a pilot program of what I&#8217;m calling like a e-commerce website in a day where, um, we have like some really specific.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steps that like we walk them through that they engage with like some forms and like, you need to gather this and you need to gather that and you need to do that. And where they kind of like walk them through prepping all the things that they need and making some of the preliminary decisions. And then, um, they literally schedule a day with us where we&#8217;re just gonna crank out, um, you know, we&#8217;re gonna start with our, our skeleton theme and just be able to get them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A site up and going because they&#8217;ve done all of the preliminary work, will import their products, you know, all of that stuff, and it&#8217;ll happen on that day, and then they&#8217;ll have a website. Um, that&#8217;s fantastic. I&#8217;m really excited about it. I [00:35:00] did kind of a really, a trial project with someone last year and, um, she, she does pottery and so this is again, Our, we&#8217;ve been with these really established small businesses, but starting to kind of find some people that are just getting started on their business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And after we launched her site, she was like, I just did a new product drop and I made $4,000 at a time of the year where I wouldn&#8217;t have done an in-person event and would not have made any money. You know? And she&#8217;s like, Like, I can&#8217;t believe I waited this long to have my own website. Um, and so I&#8217;m excited about like that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> that&#8217;s so fun when you&#8217;re able to, yeah. The work you&#8217;re doing contributes to this big win where someone&#8217;s in that setting able to like start and grow their business in a really tough time. Uh, and then like your furniture, uh, example is help them make processes more efficient and grow their [00:36:00] business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Exciting work. Thank you, Christie, for sharing your story. And, um, tell us finally where they can find out about more about you and your, your work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> Yeah, so, um, north ux design.com is where you can certainly know all about North UX and what we&#8217;re doing and, um, Whatnot. And then as far as me, best place is probably Twitter, which, um, my personal Twitter is Chrissy Ray, k r i s s i e r a e.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I do have a North Uax design Twitter as well. Um, but it&#8217;s not quite as, it&#8217;s a little bit more, you know, polished professional. I don&#8217;t engage with it quite as much, but those are great places to find me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, thank you Christy, for this time and sharing your</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Krissie VandeNoord:</strong> story. Yeah, thanks so much for having me.</p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 20:06:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Olivia Bisset\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 09:44:53 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 09:30:28 GMT\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20230112023427\";}', 'no');
